Active was a ship built in 1764. She transported convicts to Australia in 1791. She returned home via Bombay, carrying a cargo for the British East India Company (EIC). A French privateer captured her in May 1793 as she was returning to Britain.


== Convict transport ==
She served the EIC from 1791 until 1793. Under the command of Master John Mitchinson, she departed Plymouth on 27 March 1791 as part of the third fleet, and arrived on 26 September 1791 in Port Jackson, New South Wales. She embarked 175 male convicts, 21 of whom died during the voyage.
Active left Port Jackson on 3 December 1791, in company with Albemarle.


== Fate ==
Active left Bombay on 23 December 1792 in company with Albemarle. French privateers captured Active in May 1793. One source states that she was coming from Canton and that her captor took her to Morlaix, France. A contemporary report in Lloyd's List reports Active as having come from Bombay, and her captor taking her into Brest. The same issue has a separate report of a privateer having taken Albemarle and having sent her into France. A later report has Albemarle going into Morlaix.

ActiveColumbiana County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2010 census, the population was 107,841. The county seat is Lisbon. The county name is derived from the explorer of the Americas, Christopher Columbus.
Columbiana County comprises the Salem, Ohio Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Youngstown–Warren, OH-PA Combined Statistical Area. It also abuts the Pittsburgh area directly to the east and south. Pittsburgh International Airport is only a 35-minute drive southeast of East Liverpool, while Downtown Pittsburgh is only 50 minutes away.
Due to its location, Columbiana County is traditionally considered part of both Appalachian Ohio and the Steel Valley, sharing more in common culturally with neighboring Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia (both of which are also part of Appalachia) than much of Northeast Ohio in general. Officially considered part of the Youngstown television market, the Steubenville television market regularly reports in the area as well.


== History ==
The principal historic Indian tribes in the area were the Wyandots, Mingoes, and Delawares. Throughout the second half of the 18th century white explorers, starting with Christopher Gist in 1750, came to the area. George Washington, while engaged in land examinations, camped in the area of present-day East Liverpool in 1774.
Columbiana County was founded in 1803 and named in honor of Christopher Columbus. It was the scene of one of the northern-most action fought during the American Civil War; in July 1863 Confederate raiders under John Morgan were surrounded and captured by Union forces.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 535 square miles (1,390 km2), of which 532 square miles (1,380 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2) (0.5%) is water.

Columbiana County FairArniston was an East Indiaman that made eight voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). She was wrecked on 30 May 1815 during a storm at Waenhuiskrans, near Cape Agulhas, South Africa, with the loss of 372 lives – only six on board survived. She had been requisitioned as a troopship and was underway from Ceylon to England on a journey to repatriate wounded soldiers from the Kandyan Wars.
Controversially, the ship did not have a marine chronometer on board, a comparatively new and expensive navigational instrument that would have enabled her to determine her longitude accurately. Instead, she was forced to navigate through the heavy storm and strong currents using older, less reliable navigational aids and dead reckoning. Navigational difficulties and a lack of headway led to an incorrect assumption that Cape Agulhas was Cape Point. Consequently, the ship was wrecked when the captain headed north for St Helena with the incorrect belief the ship had already passed Cape Point.


== Overview ==
East Indiamen operated under charter or licence to the Honourable East India Company, which held a monopoly granted by Queen Elizabeth I of England for all English trade between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. Arniston was built at the Barnard yard at Deptford on the Thames and launched in 1794.
Arniston was heavily armed, with her fifty-eight guns making her the equivalent of a Royal Navy fourth-rate ship of the line. A classification of "ship of the line" – a class of ship that later evolved into the battleship – meant that a ship was powerful enough to stand in a line of battle and explained why these ships of commerce were sometimes mistaken for men-o-war. The armament was necessary for the ship to protect herself and her valuable cargo from pirates and commerce raiders of other nations during long voyages between Europe and the Far East. Arniston, like other East Indiamen, was slow and unmanoeuvrable, but able to carry a large quantity of cargo.


== Voyages (1794–1812) ==
Arniston sailed from Great Britain to the Far East eight times before her last voyage. On one of her homeward journeys from China, she struck an uncharted rock at 5°46′8″S 105°16′43″E, near the island of Pulo Goondy (modern day Pulau Legundi), located just south of Sumatra. She did not suffer any ill effects as a result of this incident however, which is mentioned in journals of the time only for its noteworthiness as a navigation hazard to other shipping.
Apart from this and another incident in 1800, Arniston's first eight voyages were uneventful.


=== Voyage #1: St Helena, Madras, and China (1795-97) ===
Captain Campbell Marjoribanks:
3 April 1795: Portsmouth
14 April: Tenerife
2 June: St Helena
9 August: Cape of Good Hope
27 September: Madras
14 November: Penang
3 December: Malacca
11 March 1796: Whampoa
23 April: Second Bar
29 June: Macau
20 November: St Helena
1 March 1797: Deptford
While Arniston was at St Helena on her outward journey, she undertook to transport troops from there to join Lord Elphinstone, who was undertaking an expedition to capture Cape Colony from the Dutch. On 10 July George Vancouver arrived in HMS Discovery. Vancouver was returning to England after his four-and-a-half-year long voyage of exploration. He transferred to Arniston four field guns that he had been carrying, together with what ammunition he had left for them, for onward transmission to Elphinstone. Discovery's boats also helped in the ferrying of troops from shore to Arniston.
Arniston was to ferry nine field pieces, as well as a company of artillery and three of infantry (393 men in all), to Elphinstone.


=== Voyage #2: China (1797-98) ===
On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain William Macnamara, and dated 13 May 1797. Her itinerary was:
5 June 1797: Portsmouth
29 August: Cape of Good Hope
9 December: Whampoa
14 February 1798: Second Bar
26 March: Macau
5 August: St Helena
23 October: Long Reach


=== Voyage #3: St Helena, Benkulen, and China (1800-01) ===
On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain Campbell Marjoribanks, and dated 29 November 1799. Her itinerary was:
7 January 1800: Portsmouth
4 April: St Helena
27 June: Benkulen
29 July: Penang
27 August: Malacca
21 September: Whampoa
29 November: Second Bar
18 January 1801: Macau
15 April: St Helena
17 June: Long Reach
During this voyage Arniston had just anchored at Benkulen on 27 June 1800, when the 26-gun French privateer Confiance attacked her. Arniston cut her anchor and gave chase, firing several broadsides into the other ship, but the faster French ship was able to make an escape. On 9 October 1800, the East Indiaman Kent would be less fortunate; Confiance would capture Kent after a two-hour engagement.


=== Voyage #4: St Helena, Benkulen, and China (1801-03) ===
Captain Campbell Marjoribanks:
31 December 1801: Downs
9 March 1802: St Helena
10 June: Benkulen
12 July: Penang
31 August: Whampoa
24 October: Second Bar
11 February 1803: St Helena
26 April: Long Reach


=== Voyage #5: China (1804-05) ===
On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain James Jameson, and dated 24 March 1804. Her itinerary was:
9 June 1804: Portsmouth
17 August: Rio de Janeiro
14 January 1805: Whampoa
14 February: Second Bar
21 March: Malacca
30 June: St Helena
15 September: Long Reach
This journey included a passage through the Bass Strait to improve an earlier nautical chart of the route.


=== Voyage #6: China (1806-07) ===
On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain Peter Wedderburn, and dated 20 March 1806. Her itinerary was:
14 May 1806: Portsmouth
7 August: Cape of Good Hope
10 October: Penang
21 January 1807: Whampoa
4 May: off Lintin Island
1 July: Penang
17 July: Acheh
19 September: Cape of Good Hope
13 October: St Helena
6 January 1808: Lower Hope


=== Voyage #7: Bombay and China (1810-11) ===
Captain Samuel Landon:
21 January 1810: Portsmouth
9 April: Cape of Good Hope
26 May: Bombay
1 September: Penang
12 October: Whampoa
29 December: Second Bar
28 May 1811: St Helena
13 August: Long Reach


=== Voyage #8: Bombay and China (1812-13) ===
On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain Walter Campbell. Her itinerary was:
4 January 1812: Torbay
5 April: Johanna
7 May: Bombay
11 September: Whampoa
4 January 1813: Macau
27 March: St Helena
7 June: Long Reach
The British government then chartered Arniston as a troop transport to the Cape and India.


=== Voyage #9: Madeira, Cape, and Ceylon (1814-1815) ===
Captain George Simpson left England on 8 June 1814. At Ceylon, Arniston embarked soldiers of the 73rd Regiment, who were wounded in the Kandyan Wars in Ceylon, to repatriate them to England.


== Wreck (1815) ==

Critically, the ship did not have a chronometer for this voyage, a comparatively new and expensive navigational instrument at the time. Captain George Simpson could not afford the 60–100 guineas for one, and the ship's owners were also unwilling to purchase one, even threatening to replace him with another captain if he refused to set sail without one.
Arniston sailed from Port de Galle on 4 April 1815 in a convoy of six other East Indiamen, under the escort of HMS Africaine and HMS Victor. Among her 378 passengers were many invalid soldiers and sailors, plus 14 women and 25 children.
During the passage from Ceylon, at one o'clock every day, the ships signalled each other their longitude that they calculated using their chronometers. In this way, the ships were able to compare their respective instruments, and the master of the Arniston was able to learn his longitude too, as long as he remained in the convoy.
On 26 May, while rounding the southern tip of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.

On 29 May, land was sighted to the north at 7 am, and given the dead reckoning estimates, was presumed to be the Cape of Good Hope. The ship sailed west until 4:30 pm on 29 May, then turned north to run for St Helena. However the land sighted had in fact been Cape Agulhas (then known as "Cape L'Agullas") and the ship had also not made good headway against the current since this sighting. Compounding these navigational errors, the master had not taken any depth soundings (which would have confirmed his location over the Agulhas Bank), before heading north. Consequently, instead of being 100 miles (160 km) west of the Cape of Good Hope as presumed, the ship was closing on the reef at Waenhuiskrans near Cape Agulhas. The anchors were unable to hold the heavy ship in the storm, so on 30 May near 4 pm, Lieutenant Brice advised Captain Simpson to ground the ship to save the lives of those aboard. Eight minutes later, at about 8 pm, the ship struck rocks half a mile offshore and heeled into the wind. The guns on the opposite side were cut away in a failed attempt to level the ship, which soon started to break up in the waves.
Only six men of the 378 people on board survived, after reaching the shore only with great difficulty through the high surf. The following morning the sternpost was the only part of the vessel still visible. The ship and her passengers had been lost for the price of a chronometer, or as an officer from the same convoy later wrote:

[T]his valuable ship, and all the lives on board of her, were actually sacrificed to a piece of short-sighted economy. That they might have been saved, had she been supplied with the worst chronometer that was ever sent to sea, is also quite obvious.


== Aftermath ==
The six survivors buried the bodies found on the beach, then travelled east along the beach, expecting to reach Cape Town. However, after four and a half days, they realised their error and returned to the site of the wreck. Here they subsisted off a cask of oatmeal, while trying to effect repairs to the ship's pinnace, which had been washed ashore. They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer's son, who was out hunting.
Among the victims were: Captain George Simpson, Lieutenant Brice, Lord and Lady Molesworth.
The six survivors were: Dr. Gunter (boatswain), John Barrett (carpenter), Charles Stewart Scott (carpenter's mate), William Grung (second class), Gibbs (third class), Robinson (fourth class).
A memorial, a replica of which can be seen today, was erected on the beach by the wife of Colonel Giels, whose four children were lost in the tragedy on their homeward journey, having visited him in Ceylon. The memorial bears the following inscription:

Erected by their disconsolate parents to the memory of Thomas, aged 13 years, William Noble, aged 10, Andrew, aged 8 and Alexander McGregor Murray, aged 7 (the four eldest sons of Lieut Colonel Andrew Giels of H.M. 73rd Regiment) who, with Lord and Lady Molesworth unfortunately perished in the Arniston Transport, wrecked on this shore on 3rd May, 1815.

Over time, the seaside village of Waenhuiskrans has become so associated with the wreck, that it now is also known as Arniston. The nearby town of Bredasdorp has a museum dedicated to the wreck. The wreck had a direct influence on the decision to build a lighthouse at Cape Agulhas to the west in 1847–1848.
Thirty seven years later, the 73rd Regiment once again suffered hundreds of casualties on this coast when HMS Birkenhead was wrecked only 50 miles (80 km) away at Gansbaai.


== Archaeological excavation ==
The wreck, which lies in about 6 metres (20 ft) of water, was surveyed by an archaeological team from the University of Cape Town (UCT) in 1982. The National Monuments Council issued a permit to UCT student Jim Jobling to conduct an underwater survey of the site, as well as a limited excavation. A number of artefacts were recovered, which were donated to the Bredasdorp Shipwreck Museum.

The history of the HMS Arniston in connection with the village ArnistonAntelope was a packet ship built for the British East India Company (EIC) in 1781. She made one voyage for the company that ended when she was wrecked on 10 August 1783 off Ulong, near Koror Island in Palau. This resulted in the first sustained European contact with those islands.

Captain Henry Wilson left the Downs on 6 February 1781 to carry despatches to China via the Pacific route. However, Antelope did not leave Falmouth until 2 September. On 16 December she was off Cape San Diego, Argentina, and then on 2 January 1782 she was off Cape Horn. She reached the Sulu Sea on 23 April, Cageyan Sulu on 30 April, Balambangan on 14 May, and arrived at Macao on 4 June. On 16 September 1782 Antelope left Calcutta.
She left Macao on 20 July 1783 and wrecked on 10 August on the Pelew Islands. Captain and crew built a boat, leaving on 12 November and arriving on 30 November back at Macao.
One contemporary report gave the location of the wreck at about 7°19′N 134°40′E. However, this is east of Palau, and Ulong is west of Palau at about 7.283274°N 134.282627°E﻿ / 7.283274; 134.282627. Antelope's reckoning appears to have been off by some 26 miles.
Wilson brought with him Prince Lee Boo, and left behind Madan Blanchard, a seaman who chose not to leave. Blanchard died in an engagement with locals sometime before 1790.
The painter Arthur William Devis was a passenger on Antelope when she wrecked.

== EIC voyages ==


=== EIC voyage #1 (1781-83) ===
Asia, under the command of Captain Robert Maw, sailed from Portsmouth on 13 March 1781, bound for Bombay and China as part of a convoy of Indiamen accompanying a British squadron under Commodore George Johnstone. At about the same time as the British sailed, a French squadron under the command of Bailli de Suffren left France. Both squadrons were en route to the Cape of Good Hope, the British to take it from the Dutch, the French aiming to help defend it and French possessions in the Indian Ocean, including Rodriguez Island, Ile Bourbon (Réunion), Île de France (Mauritius), and Pondicherry.
The British stopped at São Tiago to take on water, with Asia arriving on 10 April. The French squadron attacked the British on 16 April in the battle of Porto Praya. Due to the unexpected nature of the encounter, neither fleet was prepared to do battle, and the result was an inconclusive battle in which the French warships sustained more damage than did the British. Though the battle was inconclusive, it did enable the French to forestall the British attack on the Cape. The British sailed on to the Cape, with Asia arriving there on 21 July. At the Cape, Johnstone captured five Dutch East Indiamen at the battle of Saldanha Bay. The British Indiamen then sailed on, directly, or indirectly, to India.
Asia sailed to Johanna, which she reached on 3 September. The convoy left Johanna on 21 or 22 September, but ran into an adverse monsoon that drove the vessels to the coast of Arabia, and especially the four Indiamen Asia, Latham, Locko, and Osterley were driven further, to Kissen Bay, near the Bab-el-Mandeb. The Indiamen were carrying the 2nd Battalion of the 42nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot. They remained there for some six weeks as the indigenes were friendly and the vessels could procure fresh food. The Highlanders entertained the indigenes with bagpipe music, and danced the Highland Fling; the indigenes reciprocated with a war dance involving shields and spears. The Indiamen arrived at Mocha on 4 December. Asia's log book puts her at "Qishm" on 5 December. Whether this was Qeshm, and she was not with the other three, or "Kissen Bay", is currently an open question. They then sailed out of the Red Sea, with Asia reaching Bombay on 4 March, two days before the others. A voyage that would take a coppered vessel not facing adverse winds about two-and-a-half weeks had taken the four Indiamen five-and-a-half months.
Asia left Bombay on 8 August in company with the Indiamen Locko. Essex, and Osterley, and the country ship Shah Byram Gore. As the squadron was sailing through the Strait of Malacca, on 9 September the ships encountered the 38-gun French frigate Pourvoyeuse, which was under the command of Captain de Lannuguy-Tromelin. After an engagement the next day that lasted some two-and-a-half hours and in which Osterley had two men killed, and Locko and Essex had several men injured from exploding cartridges, Pouvoyeuse withdrew.

On 5 October Asia reached Whampoa anchorage. On 4 January 1783, Locko, Osterley, and Asia left Whampoa. On 22 January Locko parted company with Essex and Osterley in the straits of Lombon by one account, and on the 23rd near Caremata ((1°37′S 108°53′E), by another account. Locko and Asia then parted company on 30 January at "St Clement's Bank Peels Morcop". These are probably "St Clement's Reef" and "Pulo Mancap", at the lower end of the Karimata Strait.
Asia reached St Helena on 17 June and arrived at The Downs on 28 October.
After the return to Britain of the four captains of the Indiamen that participated in the action on 10 September 1782, the EIC awarded them prizes. Robert Maw received a silver salver made in 1787 by Joseph Heriot, of London, and inscribed "The Gift of the Hon’ble East India Company to Robert Maw Esq’r Commander of the Asia East Indiaman for gallantly defending the said ship against a French frigate of 44 guns in the Straights of Malacca September, 1782."


=== EIC voyage #2 (1785-86) ===
Captain John Davy Foulkes left Portsmouth on 10 March 1785, bound for Benkulen and China. Asia reached Bencoolen on 2 July. She then sailed to Padang, which she reached on 5 Aug, before returning to Bencoolen on 19 August. Asia arrived at Whampoa on 30 October. She left on 5 March 1786, reached St Helena on 24 June, and arrived at Blackwall, London, on 20 September.


=== EIC voyage #3 (1788-89) ===
Captain Foulkes left Portsmouth on 5 April 1788, bound for Bombay and China. Asia reached Johanna on 6 July and arrived at Bombay 20 days later. She reached Batavia on 25 November, and arrived at Whampoa on 8 February 1789. She reached St Helena on 25 June and arrived at Blackwall on 3 September.


=== EIC voyage #4 (1791-92) ===
Captain Foulkes left The Downs on 26 April 1791, bound for Madras and Bengal. Asia reached Madeira on 9 May and arrived at Madras on 10 September. On 8 November she arrived at Diamond Harbour. Asia returned to Madras on 3 March 1792, and sailed to Benkulen, which she reached on 18 April. She then reached St Helena on 26 August and arrived at Blackwall on 2 November.


=== EIC voyage #5 (1794-95) ===
Captain John Davy Foulkes received a letter of marque on 6 December 1793. However, he did not sail Asia from Portsmouth, bound for Madras and Bengal, until 2 May 1794. She reached Madras on 11 September and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 15 October. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 16 December. By 31 January 1795 she was at Madras again, and then by 24 May she was at St Helena. Between 14 and 18 June Asia participated in the capture of seven Dutch ships off St Helena.
When HMS Sceptre arrived at St Helena in May she brought the news that France had invaded the Netherlands in January. Furthermore, under an order dated 9 February 1795, Royal Navy vessels and British letters of marque were to detain Dutch vessels and cargoes and bring them into British ports that they might be detained provisionally. Then on 2 June the British East India Company packet ship Swallow arrived from the Cape of Good Hope with the news than a convoy of Dutch East Indiamen had left the Cape, sailing for the Netherlands.
Captain Essington, of Sceptre formed a squadron to try and intercept the Dutch. Providentially, the General Goddard, an East Indiaman under the command of Captain William Taylor Money, was resting at St Helena while on her way back to England. The small squadron intercepted eight Dutch vessels, which surrendered on 15 June. The HEIC ships Busbridge, Captain Samuel Maitland, and Asia, Captain Foulkes, arrived on the scene and helped board the Dutch vessels. There were no casualties on either side. The British then brought their prizes into St Helena on 17 June.
By 13 September Asia had reached the River Shannon and by 27 October she was at Blackwall.
Because the capture of the Dutch vessels had occurred before Britain declared war on the Batavian Republic, the vessels became Droits to the Crown. Still, prize money, in the amount of two-thirds of the value of the Dutch ships amounted to £76,664 14s. Of this, £61,331 15s 2d was distributed among the officers and crew of Sceptre, General Goddard, Busbridge, Asia, and Swallow. The remainder went to the garrison at St Helena, and various vessels in the St Helena roads. Thirty-three years later, in July 1828, there was a small final payment.


=== EIC voyage #6 (1796-98) ===
Captain Foulkes left Portsmouth on 12 April 1796, bound for Madras, Bengal, Bombay, and China. By 21 July Asia was at Simon's Bay, and she reached Madras on 16 November. On 20 December she was at Trincomalee before returning to Madras on 4 January 1797. She arrived at Kedgeree on 1 February. She then followed the Indian coast to Anjengo, which she reached on 17 April, and then Mahé on 30 April and Bombay on 7 June. She reached Penang on 3 September, and arrived at Whampoa on 20 December. Asia reached St Helena on 5 August 1798, and arrived at Blackwall on 9 November.


== Later career ==
In 1799 Beatson & Co., London, purchased Asia to sail between London and Lisbon. Then on 31 February 1802 Beatson sold her to buyers in Embden, who renamed her Reine Louise de Prusse. She returned to the Far East trade. Lloyd's Register for 1804 gives her trade as London-Batavia. She is last listed in Lloyd's Register for 1808 on the London-Batavia trade. Her subsequent career and fate are unknown.

Convict voyage (1816)
Under the command of Walter Meriton, she sailed from Portsmouth, England on the 23 January 1816, and arrived at Port Jackson on 22 July. She embarked 194 male convicts, seven of whom died on the voyage. A detachment of 34 men of the 89th Regiment of Foot provided the guard.
Atlas left Port Jackson on 12 September bound for Batavia.
Disappearance
On 29 July 1817, Atlas dropped the pilot at Sandheads, at the mouth of the River Ganges, as she sailed from Calcutta to London. She was not heard from again.

Weatherill, Richard (1908) The ancient port of Whitby, and its ships. (Whitby: Horne & Son.)HCS Aurora, the Honourable East India Company's Ship Aurora, was a sloop-of-war launched at Bombay for the Bombay Marine, the naval arm of the British East India Company (EIC), to protect the trade in the Indian Ocean from pirates. The French captured her in late September 1810, only to have the British recapture her in early December. She returned to the service of the Bombay Marine, assisting the British Government and the Royal Navy in various campaigns in the East Indies and the Persian Gulf. She was still listed on the rolls of the Bombay Marine on 1 January 1828.


== Career ==
Aurora went into active service shortly after she was launched. Under the command of Lieutenant Conyers, she participated the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809. The Royal Navy and the EIC sent a large force to the Persian Gulf to force the Al Qasimi (or Joasmi) to cease their raids on British ships, particularly on the Persian and Arab coasts of the Straits of Hormuz. The operation's success was limited as British were unable to suppress permanently the strong fleets of the Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah.


=== Capture and recapture ===
Aurora, under the command of Lieutenant Watkins, left Bombay on 16 August 1810 on a cruise. Lloyd's List reported that the French frigates Iphigenia and Astree had captured Aurora, of 10 guns and 100 men, in October. French records reveal that Iphigénie, under Acting Captain Bouvet, and Astrée captured Aurora, of 16-guns, on 20 September 1810. Both reports agree that her captors took her to Île de France. The French Navy then took Aurora into service as the corvette Aurore.
The British recaptured Aurora, and several other EIC vessels, as a consequence of their successful invasion of Isle de France in November–December 1810. Aurora then returned to Bombay and the EIC's service.
When the French captured British vessels they tried to get sailors, marines, and in the case of EIC ships, lascars, to join the French Navy. Apparently they generally had some success, particularly with Irishmen and lascars. However, in the case of Aurora, her marine detachment of 16 or 17 sepoys, recruited from among the Concanny Purwarries and serving in the Marine Battalion of the Bombay Marine, were steadfast in resisting first blandishments and then harsh treatment.


=== Invasion of Java and punitive expeditions ===
In 1811, the Royal Navy and the EIC combined to launch an invasion of Java. The EIC contributed several warships, including Aurora, under the command of Commander Watkins, and several East Indiamen and other transports.
In December Aurora was in Calcutta when the news arrived that a large group of Burmese had invaded the area of Chittagong. Captain Macdonald of Aurora assembled a force consisting of Aurora and the EIC's cruizers Phoenix, Thetis, and Vestal, as well as a 900 troops. The Troops disembarked at Chittagong on 6 December, at which point the Burmese retreated.
In 1812, Palimbang was under British control, with Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles as the governor of British Java. The ex-sultan of Palimbang established a stockade a few miles up from the city. From there he intercepted supplies and threatened the new sultan. Major Mears of the Bombay Army and Captain MacDonald of Aurora sent 200 men in boats to capture the stockade. They were able to do so, though not without the loss of Major Mears.
That same year, HMS Phoenix, HMS Procris, and HMS Barracouta, and a detachment of 100 men from the 48th Highlanders set out on a punitive expedition against the Sultanate of Sambas, along the Sambas River in western Borneo. Barracouta was unable to force the river defenses and the expedition retreated after she suffered some casualties.
From January Aurora and some gunboats then maintained a blockade until a second punitive expedition arrived in June 1813. While she maintained the blockade, Aurora recaptured some valuable Chinese junks, and unsuccessfully chased the ship Coromandel, up the river.
For the second punitive expedition against Sambas, the Royal Navy contingent consisted of Leda, Hussar, Malacca, Volage, Hecate, and Procris, with Captain Sayer of Leda as the senior naval officer. The EIC contributed the cruisers Malabar, Teignmouth, and Aurora, seven gunboats, the transport Troubridge, and the East Indiaman Princess Charlotte of Wales. The army contingent consisted of the 14th Regiment of Foot, a company each from the Bengal artillery and the HEIC's European Regiment, and the 3rd Bengal Volunteer Battalion. Eventually the British vessels, except the frigates, were able to cross the bar in front of the river and move towards the town of Sambas. Capturing two forts yielded over 70 brass and iron guns of mixed calibers, but the town of itself yielded little booty. The expedition was able to recapture the Portuguese brig Coromandel, which the pirates had captured the year before. British casualties from combat were relatively low, but casualties from fever and disease were high.
In early 1814 the British Army officer in charge at Palimbang replaced the current sultan with the old sultan, in retirement in the interior. Raffles sent Captain MacDonald and Aurora, to investigate the situation. The old sultan was deposed and the his predecessor reinstated.
In April, the EIC put together a small force consisting of Malabar, under Captain Robert Deane, the overall naval commander, Teignmouth, Aurora, and some gunboats, and an Army contingent under the command of Major-General Miles Nightingale. On 7 June the British attacked Makassar, burning the rajah's palace. The rajah fled and the British were able to impose a new rajah. Shortly thereafter, Aurora returned to Calcutta, carrying the Army staff and several officials.


=== Incident in 1816 ===
Maratha raiders posed a longstanding problem for the EIC. Apparently in 1816 Aurora engaged in combat with a flotilla of these raiders, supposedly in the Bay of Bengal. The painting above shows Aurora engaging two grabs and numerous gallivats.
The problem with Mahrata pirates ended with the British victory in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–18), which brought the Maratha Empire under EIC control.


=== Incident in 1817 ===
In January 1817 Aurora was under the command of Captain Jeakes. She was towing a large "baghalah', which carried treasure from Kuwait and destined for the Imaum of Muscat. As they were sailing down the Gulf, 15 "dhows and trankies" manned by Jaoasmi pirates attacked them, attempting to capture the baghalah. Jeakes managed by skilful sailing to maneuver Aurora to bring her guns to bear and sink many of the dhows. When Aurora and the baghalah arrived at Muscat, the Imaum presented Captain Jeakes with a valuable sword and an Arabian horse. Aurora then continued her journey onto Bombay.


=== Punitive expedition against Ras-al-Khaima ===
In late 1819 Captain Francis Augustus Collier of Liverpool to command the naval portion of a joint navy-army punitive expedition against the pirates at Ras al-Khaimah in the Persian Gulf. The naval force consisted of Liverpool, Eden, Curlew, several EIC cruisers including Aurora, and a number of gun and mortar boats. Aurora was under the command of Lieutenant Maillard. Later several vessels belonging to the Sultan of Muscat joined them. On the army side, Major General Sir William Keir commanded some 5,000 troops in transports. Aurora and Nautilus supported the landing of the troops with a "well-directed fire".
After destroying Ras-al-Khaima, the British then spent the rest of December and early January moving up and down the coast destroying forts and vessels. The capture and destruction of the fortifications and ships in the port was a massive blow for the Gulf pirates. British casualties were minimal.


== Fate ==
The last readily available online mention of Aurora notes that she was still listed as serving the Bombay Marine on 1 January 1828.

During the first of these voyages she transported convicts from Britain to New South Wales. She continued trading until sometime between 1813 and 1818.
Bellona was launched in 1782 at Limehouse by Woolcombe for Boyd & Co. She then traded for a decade before, in 1792, commencing a series of four voyages for the EIC. During her career she was captured once and recaptured, and seized once, before a French privateer finally captured her in 1811 and scuttled her.


== Career ==


=== EIC voyage #1 (1792-94) ===
Captain Matthew Boyd sailed from Gravesend, England, on 8 August 1792, bound for New South Wales and China. The government chartered Bellona for the voyage, paying £4 4s/ton (bm)/month. Bellona carried 17 female convicts, five free settlers and their families, and a cargo of stores. The free settlers were the first free settlers to come to Australia. He reached Rio de Janeiro on 18 October, and arrived at Port Jackson, New South Wales on 16 January 1793. The stores were five pipes of port wine, some rum, and 3000 lbs of tobacco. Unfortunately, bad weather on the journey had spoilt a large part of the most useful articles.
After delivering convicts, settlers, and cargo, Bellona sailed for China on 19 February. On the way, in February–March, Matthew Boyd discovered a reef system near New Caledonia. The Bellona Reefs are named in honour of the ship. Bellona reached Penang on 16 May and Malacca on 23 June, and arrived at Whampoa on 22 July. She was at the Second Bar on 20 December. On 1 January 1794, five East Indiamen set out together, in order: Bombay Castle, Chesterfield, Brunswick, Minerva, and Bellona. Bellona reached St Helena 20 April 1794 and Galway on 20 July, and arrive at Long Reach on 30 August.


=== EIC voyage #2 (1795-96) ===
Captain William Ward Farrer left the Downs on 12 July 1795, bound for Bengal. Bellona arrived at Calcutta on 7 December. While he was underway, he was issued a letter of marque on 19 September 1796. This authorized him to take offensive action against the French or their allies, not just defensive.
On the return leg of her voyage, Bellona passed Saugor on 3 February 1796, reached the Cape on 18 April and St Helena on 5 May, and arrived at Long Reach on 8 August.


=== EIC voyage #3 (1796-98) ===
Captain William Ward Farrer sailed from the Downs on 3 October 1796, bound for Madras and Amboina. Bellona reached Madras on 12 February 1797, Trincomalee on 11 March, and Pondicherry on 21 March. She returned to Madras on 26 March, reached Malacca on 6 June, and arrived at Amboina on 19 August. She left Amboina on 1 January 1798, reached the Cape on 17 March, St Helena on 15 April, and Cork on 25 June. She arrived at Long Reach on 10 July.


=== Jamaica trader (1799-1800) ===
Lloyd's Register gives the name of Bellona's owner as "Wddrbrn", her master as E. Lamb, and her trade as London-Jamaica.
Lloyd's List reported on 13 June 1800 that "the Bellona, Lamb, has been taken by two French privateers, after an engagement of two hours; since retaken and arrived at Jamaica." The recapture was the work of HMS Merlin, which captured the "English Ship Bellona, of Ten Guns, and Six Hundred Tons, from London, bound to Saint Lucie".


=== EIC voyage #4 (1801-02) ===
Captain Edwin Lamb sailed from the Downs on 14 January 1801, bound for Madras and Calcutta. Bellona reached Madras on 17 June and Calcutta on 24 June. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 8 September, reached St Helena on 1 January 1802, and arrived at Gravesend on 3 March. On 30 March the Court of Directors of the United Company of Merchants trading with the East Indies (the EIC), announced that on 22 April they would offer for sale 37,000 bags of rice brought by the Hind, Hope, Minerva, Ceres, and Bellona.


== Subsequent career and fate ==
Lloyd's Register of 1802 gives her master as "Lamb", her owner as "Boyd & Co.", and her trade as London to India. This information continues unchanged through 1804. However, there are accounts that Boyd & Co. sold Bellona to foreign buyers in 1802, but repurchased her in 1804.
There may be a related explanation for a break in 1803. The Morning Post, of London, England, reported on 5 November 1803 that: "The Batavia, Jansen, and the Bellona, Lamb, from Batavia to Amsterdam, are captured by the Governor of St. Helena." Coming from Batavia, the two vessels may not have realized that war with France and her allies, including the Batavian Republic, had recommenced in May. This would have provided grounds for the seizure of the two vessels as they arrived at St Helena.
Lloyd's Register of 1805 gives the name of Bellona's master as "Lamb", her owner as "Boyd & Co.", and her trade as London transport. The Caledonian Mercury reported on 8 September 1806 that “The Bellona, transport, Lamb, has been on shore at Plymouth, and received damage.”


== Fate ==
On 28 February 1811, the French privateer Invincible Napoleon captured Bellona as she was sailing from London to Amelia Island, Florida. The French set their prize on fire, scuttling her. The entry in Lloyd's Register from 1805 continued unchanged until Bellona was last listed in 1813.

In 1796 she transported convicts from Ireland to Australia. This voyage was noteworthy for her captain's cruelty, for which he was tried but not sanctioned. She then sailed to China to pick up a cargo for the East India Company. On the way she visited or saw four islands in the present-day Marshall Islands. She remained employed in the services of the East India Company until 1799.


== Voyages ==
In November 1774, Britannia sailed from London to Charleston, South Carolina. In addition to passengers, she was carrying "seven chests of East Indian tea." The Captain, Samuel Ball, Jr., said that the tea had been ordered "without his knowledge or consent." Because of local objections to the British duty on tea, "on Thursday at Noon [November 3, 1774], an Oblation was made to Neptune." This incident has been called "The Charleston Tea Party" because the tea was dumped over the side, in the same fashion as had occurred at the Boston Tea Party a year earlier.
Captain Thomas Dennett (or Dennott) sailed Britannia from Calcutta on 28 November 1785 and Diamond Harbour on 4 January 1786. She reached the Cape on 2 March, and St Helena on 23 March. She arrived at Plymouth on 15 May and Deptford on 8 June. 
Convict ship
On 5 August 1796, Thomas Demmett [sic] received a letter of marque, which authorized him to capture French ships should the opportunity arise. Under the command of Thomas Dennett, Britannia departed Cork, Ireland on 10 December, carrying 144 male and 44 female prisoners, and arrived in Sydney Cove on 27 May 1797. Ten male convicts and one female convict died during the course of the voyage. An enquiry into the conduct of Captain Dennott (Demmett) was held in Sydney and is recorded in the Historical Records of Australia. The enquiry recommendations as to Demmett's "callous and brutal" treatment of the convicts was sent to England but the only repercussion was that Demmett never served on a convict ship again. Meanwhile the Britannia III departed Port Jackson on 2 December for England, via China.
Exploration
Britannia left Sydney on 2 August 1797 for China, where she would pick up a cargo of tea. She initially followed the route that Scarborough followed. Britannia sailed north and into the region of the Marshall Islands. On 19 September she sighted an island that Dennott named "Hunter Island" (Kili Island). Canoes brought out some islanders who wanted to trade breadfruit. The next day she sighted an island in the Ailinglaplap Atoll that Dennott named "Lamber Island". Natives again came out to trade but Britannia sailed on. Later that day Britannia did stop at an island in Namu Atoll that Dennott named "Ross Island". This time Britannia stopped and traded with the natives who came out. One native tore off a galley rail and took it away as a prize. On 21 September Britannia sighted "Princess Island" at 8°21′N 167°25′E; this would appear to be Lib Island.
Dennett arrived at Macao on 16 October 1797 and was at Whampoa on 2 December. For her return to Britain, Britannia was at Macao on 28 March 1798, False Bay on 25 July, the Cape on 8 September, and St Helena on 17 November. Britannia reached the Downs on 4 February 1799. She reached London on 7 February.
Dennott left Britannia and apparently died around 1800. Lloyd's Register for 1800 records her owner as Lambert, and her master as "Palmer".


== London-India trade ==
On 28 May 1799, Britannia sailed from London for Madras. On 24 September she left the Cape in company with the American armed ship Atlantic. The two planned on sailing together as far as "Achun Head" (Aceh). On 8 October a ship came into sight and appeared to be chasing them, but they separated and both escaped. Britannia arrived back in London on 30 September 1800.
Lloyd's Register for 1801 repeats the names of owner and master from the prior volume, but indicates a change with the name of Britannia's new owner as "Cleland Co." and the name of her master as "J. Johnson". It also indicates that she carried two 9-pounder guns and ten short 9-pounders "on the New Construction".
Britannia sailed from London on 21 January 1801 for Madeira and India. In Portsmouth her captain was relieved by Captain Stout. Benjamin Stout had received a letter of marque for Britannia two days earlier. She returned to London from Bengal on 31 May 1802.
In 1802 Captain J. Reddy replaced Stout, though her master had still been listed as J. Johnson. Captain James Reddy, of Britannia was reported to have died in Bengal on 29 August 1803.
Contradictorily, another report has Britannia still under Reddy's command between 1808 and 1810, with Cleland & Co. employing her on the South Sea whale fishery. The 1809 Lloyd's Register still shows her trading on the India-London route, with Reddy as master.

Brittania (1774) GeoCities pageHMS Calcutta was the East Indiaman Warley, converted to a Royal Navy 56-gun fourth rate. This ship of the line served for a time as an armed transport. She also transported convicts to Australia in a voyage that became a circumnavigation of the world. The French 74-gun Magnanime captured Calcutta in 1805. In 1809, after she ran aground during the Battle of the Basque Roads and her crew had abandoned her, a British boarding party burned her.


== East Indiaman ==
The East Indiaman Warley was built at John Perry's Blackwall Yard in 1788, the first vessel of the name that Perry built for the East India Company. She made two trading voyages to the Far East for the East India Company. Warley's captain for her two voyages was Charles Wilson. Her letter of marque was issued on 7 September 1793.
On her second voyage, in July 1793, Warley, Triton, and Royal Charlotte, together with HMS Minerva, participated in the capture of Pondicherry by maintaining a blockade of the port. The Indiamen then sailed for China in early September.
On their way to China, the same East Indiamen participated in an action in the Straits of Malacca. They came upon a French frigate, with some six or seven of her prizes, replenishing her water casks ashore. The three British vessels immediately gave chase. The frigate fled towards the Sunda Strait. The Indiamen were able to catch up with a number of the prizes, and after a few cannon shots, were able to retake them. The British restored the prizes to their crews and took the French prize crews as prisoners of war. Had they not carried letters of marque, such behaviour might well have qualified as piracy.
When Warley was at Whampoa that December she joined other East Indiamen there, among which were several that on their return to Britain the Admiralty would purchase: Royal Charlotte, Ceres, Earl of Abergavenny, and Hindostan. The British Government had chartered Hindostan to take Lord Macartney to China in an unsuccessful attempt to open diplomatic and commercial relations with the Chinese empire.


== Cruiser and armed transport ==
In early 1795, the Royal Navy purchased the first Warley and had her original builders, Perry & Co., refit her as a 56-gun fourth rate, under the name Calcutta, at a cost of £10,300. She was one of nine large merchantmen that the Navy Board purchased that year for conversion to convoy escorts.
Captain William Bligh was her first commander, assigned to her to supervise her conversion. He took command on 16 April 1795 and commissioned her in May. In October 1795, the crew of the 74-gun HMS Defiance (then commanded by Captain Sir George Horne) mutinied. Bligh, in Calcutta, was ordered to embark 200 troops and take them alongside Defiance so that they might board her and regain control. The threat of the soldiers ended the mutiny for the time being, though the crew of the Defiance mutinied again in 1797 and 1798. Bligh continued to command Calcutta until she was paid off in February 1796 and transferred to the Transport Board.
In order for her to fulfill her new role, the Transport Board had the guns on her lower deck removed. As a result she no longer needed as large a crew and her complement fell to 160 officers and men. Calcutta served in the transport role under Lieutenants Robert Arnold (June 1796 – August 1797), Edward Jekyll Canes (August 1797 – January 1798), Richard Pouldon (or Poulden, or Polden; January 1798 – December 1799). and John Anderson (December 1799 – May 1802).
Under Poulden Calcutta was at the capture of Minorca in December 1798. On 11 November she was part of a squadron that unsuccessfully chased four Spanish frigates, though two days later Argo recaptured the sloop Peterel, which the Spaniards had captured on the 11th.
Lieutenant John Anderson (December 1799 – May 1802) replaced Pouldon. On 6 June 1800 he sailed Calcutta to Gibraltar, carrying the Banffshire Fencibles.


=== Convict transport ===

Between May 1802 and February 1803, the Navy had Calcutta fitted out as a transport for convicts being sent to Britain's penal colonies in Australia. She received new armament in the form of sixteen 24-pounder carronades on her upper deck and two six-pounder guns on the forecastle. Captain Daniel Woodriff recommissioned her in November 1802 and sailed her from Spithead on 28 April 1803, accompanied by Ocean, to establish a settlement at Port Phillip. Calcutta carried a crew of 150, together with 308 male convicts, along with civil officers, marines, and some wives and children. The Reverend Robert Knopwood kept a journal on the voyage.

She reached Rio de Janeiro on 19 July, and the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 August. While Calcutta was at the Cape, a vessel arrived with news that Britain was now at war with the Batavian Republic. The colony's Dutch commodore sent a representative aboard Calcutta to demand her surrender and that of her contents. While the representative waited, Woodriff spent two hours preparing her for battle. He then showed the representative her sailors and marines at their guns, and told the Dutchman to inform the commodore that "if he wants this ship he must come and take her if he can". To speed up the preparations, William Gammon, the master's mate, had asked the convicts if any would volunteer to fight and work the ship. All volunteered. The commodore gave Woodriff 24 hours to leave, saying that he "did not wish to capture such a large number of thieves".
On 12 October, she reached her destination. However, David Collins, the commander of the expedition, found that the poor soil and shortage of fresh water made the area unsuitable for a colony. Collins wanted to move the colony to the Derwent River on the south coast of Tasmania (then Van Diemens Land) to the site of current-day Hobart. Woodriff refused the use of Calcutta, arguing that Ocean was large enough to transport the colony, and that he was under orders to pick up naval supplies for transport to England. In December Woodriff sailed to Sydney where he took on a cargo of lumber. At midnight on 4 March, Woodriff landed 150 of his crew and marines to assist the New South Wales Corps and the Loyal Association, a local militia, in suppressing a convict uprising in support of the Castle Hill convict rebellion, a revolt by some 260 Irish convicts against Governor King. Afterward, the commander of the marine detachment on Calcutta, Charles Menzies, offered his services to the governor as superintendent of a new settlement at Coal Harbour, an offer Governor King accepted. Another Calcutta officer, Lieut. John Houston, accepted an appointment as acting Lieutenant Governor of Norfolk Island while Major Joseph Foveaux was on leave.
Calcutta left on 17 March 1804, doubled Cape Horn and reached Rio on 22 May. In reaching Rio, she had thus circumnavigated the world in ten months three days. She arrived at Spithead on 23 July.


== Ship of the line ==

In September 1804 the Admiralty again fitted out Calcutta for duty as a cruiser, re-arming her as a 56-gun fourth rate.


=== Capture ===
On 3 August 1805, Calcutta, still under the command of Captain Woodriff, left St Helena as escort of a motley convoy to England. The convoy consisted of the East India company's "extra-ship" Indus, from Madras, the southern whaler African from Desolation, the whaler Fox from the Mozambique channel, the whaler Grand Sachem from the Peruvian coast and bound to Milford, the Prussian ship Wilhelmina, which Calcutta had detained on her way out to St Helena, and the large Swedish ship Carolina, which was sailing from China and asked to join.
On 14 September, the brig Brothers, of London, from Tobago, joined the convoy. She had gotten separated from her convoy in a gale. Unfortunately, she was leaky and a very slow sailer.
On 25 September 1805, the convoy was in the Channel south of the Isles of Scilly when lookouts spotted a number of unknown vessels in the distance. Calcutta moved to position herself between the convoy and the unknown flotilla.
Next morning it became clear that the unknown vessels were probably French so Calcutta signalled the convoy to make sail without her and moved to intercept the French vessels. She sailed towards the nearest vessel, which turned out to be the 40-gun frigate Armide. The engagement was desultory but Calcutta succeeded in luring the French southward and away from the convoy. As a result, the French detached the brig Sylph which captured only the slow-sailing Brothers.
However, eventually the rest of the French squadron started to arrive. It turned out this was Allemand's squadron, which included the 74-gun Magnanime. Woodriff brought Calcutta alongside Magnanime, but after a battle of some three-quarters of an hour was forced to strike. The French had shot high, bringing down Calcutta's rigging, disabling her. Because they fired high, Calcutta suffered only six dead and six wounded out of a crew of 350. The French brought Calcutta into French service.
Woodriff was imprisoned at Verdun and appealed to Talleyrand for release, without success until in early 1807 the French sent him to Saint-Malo. There the French government provided him a vessel under cartel to take him to England. The British government immediately reciprocated by releasing a French officer of equal rank. The court-martial on Gladiator, on 1 January 1808, for Woodriff and his officers acquitted all, praising the captain for his gallantry and skilful manoeuvring, which had allowed the convoy to escape.
The owners and underwriters on the ship and cargo of the Indus, one of the East Indiamen that Calcutta had saved, proposed a subscription of 21 percent on the amount insured. The resulting money was to be presented to Woodriffe and his officers and crew as a small token of gratitude.


=== French service ===
On 12 April 1809, Calcutta was part of the squadron of La Rochelle under captain Jean Baptiste Lafon. During the Battle of the Basque Roads, Calcutta ran aground on the shoals of Les Palles, as did most of the other French ships. Under fire from Imperieuse under Captain Lord Cochrane, Calcutta's crew panicked and abandoned ship without orders. A midshipman with a small party from Imperieuse took over Calcutta, but then set her afire to prevent her re-capture, causing her to explode.
A court-martial held Lafon responsible for the loss of his ship, and deemed his behaviour to have been cowardly. In a five to four vote, the court sentenced him to death; a firing squad executed him on the deck of the Océan on 9 September.

She made three trips to China for the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). After the outbreak of war with France in 1793, the Admiralty, desirous of quickly building up the Royal Navy, purchased a number of commercial vessels, including nine East Indiamen, to meet the need for small two-decker fourth rates to serve as convoy escorts. The Admiralty purchased Ceres in 1795 and renamed her HMS Grampus. In 1797 the Admiralty converted her to a storeship. That year her crew participated in the Spithead and Nore mutinies. Grampus grounded in January 1799 and was destroyed.


== East Indiaman ==
Ceres made three trips to China for the HEIC.
1st voyage (1788-89)
Ceres's captain for her first voyage was Captain Thomas Price. He sailed her for the coast of India and China, leaving Portsmouth on 5 April 1788. She reached Madras on 15 July, and Whampoa on 2 October. On the return leg of her voyage, she crossed the Second Bar on 14 December. She reached Saint Helena on 9 April 1789 and Long Reach on 2 June. Other accounts have her returning to her moorings on 1 September 1789. In either case, Price died on 20 June.
2nd voyage (1790-1791)
Ceres's captain for her second voyage was Captain George Stevens. He too sailed her for the Indian coast and China, leaving Torbay on 6 March 1790. She reached Madras on 22 June, and Negapatam on 29 July. Two days later she was back at Madras. She then reached Whampoa on 11 October. She crossed the Second Bar on 20 January 1791, and then stopped at Macao on 17 March. She reached St Helena on 3 July, and Long Reach on 1 September.
3rd voyage (1793-94)
George Stevens was again captain of Ceres for her third voyage. She left Portsmouth on 21 May 1793, after war with France had begun on 1 February. The HEIC arranged for her to sail under a letter of marque, issued to Stevens, and dated 22 April 1793. Ceres was part of a convoy that also included the East Indiamen Prince William, Lord Thurlow, William Pitt, Barwell, Earl of Oxford, Osterley, Fort William, London, Glatton, Houghton, Marquis of Landsdown, Hillsborough, Pigot, and Earl of Abergavenny, amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.
On 24 June 1793 the fleet of Indiamen captured the French brig Franc; the crew of Ceres took possession. On 10 November Ceres reached Manilla. Then on 20 December she arrived at Whampoa. At Whampoa that December were several other East Indiamen, among which were several that on their return to Britain the Admiralty would purchase: Warley, Royal Charlotte, Earl of Abergavenny, and Hindostan. The British Government had chartered Hindostan to take Lord Macartney to China in an unsuccessful attempt to open diplomatic and commercial relations with the Chinese empire.
For her return trip, Ceres crossed the Second Bar on 18 February 1794 and stopped at Macao on 16 March. She reached St Helena on 18 June, and Long Reach on 10 September.


== Royal Navy service ==
The Admiralty purchased Ceres and commissioned her as HMS Grampus in December under Captain Alexander Christie, for the North Sea. (There was already a frigate Ceres in the Royal Navy, and a previous fourth-rate Grampus had just been sold for breaking up.) The new Grampus was commissioned on 9 March 1795. She then spent some two months with Perry at Blackwall being coppered. In September 1795 Captain John Williamson took command, and in March 1796 he sailed her for Jamaica.
Grampus shared with five other naval vessels in the prize money arising out of the capture on 1 April of the French privateer Alexander, and the salvage money from the recapture of her prize, the Portuguese vessel Nostra Signora del Monte del Carmo. Alexander was armed with ten guns and had a crew of 65 men under the command of M. Petre Edite. She was ten days out of Nantz and the capture took place at 37°11′N 18°16′W. In May, Grampus was among the vessels that took part in the campaign to capture Saint Lucia under Rear Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian and General Ralph Abercromby.
In September Grampus returned to Britain and was paid off. Two months later she was at Sheerness being fitted as a storeship. Lieutenant Charles Carne recommissioned her in December, with the refitting lasting until February 1797.
Mutiny
In April and May the Spithead and Nore mutinies broke out. Grampus was one of the vessels caught up in the disorder, and is named in the proclamation read out on 10 June. The exact date of her arrival at Sheerness, the date of her joining the mutiny, and the date of her crew returning to duty are not known. Still, she was at Sheerness by 16 May. At the time, Grampus was preparing for a voyage to the West Indies. After the reading of the Proclamation on 10 June, the crews of a number of vessels sought to abandon the mutiny. On Grampus a fight broke out between loyalists and mutineers, a fight that the mutineer faction won. Under some reports, the mutineers abandoned her.
The mutineers on the various vessels involved found Grampus particularly useful because as a storeship, stocked for a voyage, she was able to provide them with supplies. Still, after the reading of the proclamation the mutiny collapsed and by mid-June Grampus had returned to Royal Navy control. After the end of the mutiny, five men from Grampus were sentenced to death. Another account reports that three men were condemned to death and two were confined to solitary cells. Grampus then sailed for Jamaica in August.
Return to service
In Jamaica, Admiral Hyde Parker, the commander of the station, was concerned that Grampus had brought a disaffected crew that could spread mutiny there too. He identified one agitator, whom he had hanged. By 1798 Grampus was under the command of Captain George Hart, serving as a transport.


== Fate ==
On the morning of 19 January 1799, Grampus was in the Thames and under the command of Captain John Hall. She weighed at 7a.m., and took a pilot, Sammuel Richardson, on board. Nevertheless, by 9a.m. she had grounded on the Barking Shelf. She could not be refloated and so for the next three days work went on to remove her stores, her masts, and whatever else could be salvaged. On 21 January the decision was made to abandon her as by then she had 20 feet of water in her hold. The subsequent court martial absolved Captain Hall and his officers and crew of any responsibility, instead blaming Richardson's ignorance.
The wreck proved to be an obstacle to navigation so in April, the Commissioners of the Navy issued a call for proposals to "remove and clear the River Thames of the Wreck of His Majesty's late Ship Grampus, now on Shore on Barking-Shelf, opposite the Powder-Houses". On 12 April 1799, the wreck was set on fire and destroyed.

Her most notable voyage was her second when she fought in the Battle of Pulo Aura against a French squadron. In 1818 the Chilean government arranged for her purchase. When she arrived in Chile the Chileans took her into their navy as San Martín. As part of the First Chilean Navy Squadron she participated in 1818 in the defeat of a Spanish expeditionary force. She was wrecked off the coast of Peru in 1821.


== East Indiaman ==


=== Voyage #1 (1803-04) ===
Captain William Ward Farrer sailed Cumberland for the Cape, Bengal, and China, leaving the Downs on 30 January 1803. When the Napoleonic Wars broke out shortly after his departure, the EIC arranged for him to receive a letter of marque, which would authorise him to act offensively against French shipping, should the opportunity arise. Captain William Ward Tarres received a letter of marque on 20 June 1803. Cumberland reached the Cape on 27 March, and Madras on 19 May. From there she sailed to Penang, which she reached on 7 July, and Malacca, on 30 July. She arrived at Whampoa on 25 August. She was at the Second Bar on 30 October. She left China on 6 February 1804.

On 14 February a fleet of Indiamen under the command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance, which included Cumberland, intimidated, drove off, and chased a powerful French naval squadron. Although the French force was much stronger than the British convoy, Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger, whereupon he resumed his passage towards British India. Linois later claimed that the unescorted British merchant fleet was defended by eight ships of the line, a claim criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.
Cumberland reached Malacca on 18 February and Penang on 3 March, and St Helena on 10 June. She arrived at Long Reach on 14 August.
The EIC voted a £50,000 prize fund to be divided among the various commanders at the battle and their crews. Farrer received 500 guineas, and also a piece of plate worth 50 guineas. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund and other national and mercantile institutions made a series of awards of ceremonial swords, silver plate, and monetary gifts to individual officers. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave each captain a sword worth £50, and one worth £100 to Nathaniel Dance. Dance refused a baronetcy but was subsequently knighted.


=== Voyage #2 (1805-06) ===
This voyage also saw combat, but of a more minor sort. Farrer left Portsmouth on 25 April 1805, bound for Madras and China. On 7 August Cumberland was in company with the East Indiamen Ocean, Dorsetshire, and Henry Addington in a convoy escorted by naval vessels under the command of Sir Thomas Troubridge. The British, including Cumberland, exchanged fire with three French warships that included Belle Poule and Marengo, which did not press the attack.
Cumberland reached Madras on 23 August, Penang on 18 September, and Malacca on 22 October, arriving at Whampoa on 20 December. On her homeward leg, Cumberland passed Macao on 6 February 1806, and reached Malacca on 18 March, Penang on 27 March, and St Helena on 2 July. On 13 September she arrived at Long Reach.


=== Voyage #3 (1807-08) ===
Farrer left Portsmouth on 26 February 1807 for Madras and China. Cumberland returned to her moorings in Britain on 30 June 1808.


=== Voyage #4 (1808-10) ===
Captain Peter Wedderburn received a letter of marque for Cumberland on 17 December 1808. She left Portsmouth on 24 February 1809 bound for Bombay and China. She reached 25 Jun Bombay on 25 June, Penang on 31 August, ad Macao on 18 October, arriving at Whampoa on 4 November. For her return journey she crossed the Second Bar on 22 December, reaching St Helena on 21 May 1810 and arriving at Long Reach on 2 August.


=== Voyage #5 (1811-1812) ===
Captain Thomas Hutton Wilkinson received a letter of marque on 14 March 1811. He left Torbay on 16 February 1811, bound for Bombay and China. Cumberland reached Simon's Bay on 28 April and arrived at Bombay on 8 June. From there she sailed to Penang (21 August), and arrived at Whampoa on 2 October. On her homeward journey she crossed the Second Bar on 2 December, and reached St Helena on 21 March 1812. She arrived at Long Reach on 15 May Long Reach.


=== Voyage #6 (1813-14) ===
Wilkinson left Portsmouth on 18 March 1813 for China. Cumberland reached Tenerife on 11 April and the Cape on 11 June. She arrived at Whampoa on 6 September. On 5 January 1814 she crossed the Second Bar, reaching St Helena on 26 May, and arriving at Long Reach on 10 August.


=== Voyage #7 (1816-17) ===
Wilkinson left the Downs on 23 January 1816, bound for Bombay and China. Cumberland arrived at Bombay on 15 May, reached Malacca on 6 August, and arrived at Whampoa on 3 September. She crossed the Second Bar on 24 December and reached St Helena on 12 March 1817. She arrived at Long Reach on 16 May.


== Chilean Navy ==
Bernardo O'Higgins, head of the Chilean government, instructed the government's agent in London, José Antonio Álvarez Condarco, to arrange for the purchase of Cumberland. Cumberland sailed for Valparaiso on 13 February 1818.
She arrived in Chile on 22 May 1818, under the command of William Wilkinson. The Chileans purchased her for 210,000 pesos, renamed her San Martín, and armed her with 64 guns. Wilkinson remained her captain.
On 25 October 1818 the First Chilean Navy Squadron, commanded by Manuel Blanco Encalada and comprising San Martín, Lautaro, and Chacabuco, defeated a Spanish expedition. The squadron captured the Santa Isabel, and eight other Spanish transports. One transport with 100 Spanish soldiers reached safety at Callao.


== Fate ==
In July 1821 she was wrecked in the bay of Chorrilos, Peru.

In 1839 she carried mainly Scots assisted migrants to Australia, and was the first immigrant ship to sail from the Great Britain directly to Port Phillip. In 1842 she transported more than 300 convicts to Hobart.


== Career ==
David Clark sailed between India and the Mediterranean, arriving in Malta in 1820, where a portrait was made, and then returning via Gibraltar to Bengal, arriving on 27 September 1821. She was involved in the East India Company's military expedition to Burma in 1824 and 1825, and was used in the Arracan campaign as a hospital ship. She continued to trade under the East India Company flag in 1830 and sailed one of the last voyages under licence by the East India Company, through Calcutta, Singapore, China, St. Helena and finally to London between 19 August 1833 to 28 June 1834. Robert Rayne was master on this voyage, the log of which has survived.
The vessel was then surveyed in London on 16 August 1834, when it was shown that she was built of teak with two decks, and had been sheathed in wood in 1829 then in copper in 1833 at Calcutta.
She next sailed the London-Calcutta and Calcutta-China routes between 1834 to 1839 but in January 1839, having left London for India, had to put in at Cowes due to leaking; she discharged her cargo before going to Greenock for a refit.
She was under the command of Capt. J.B. Mills when she left Greenock on 15 June 1839 carrying mainly Scots assisted immigrants. She arrived at Port Phillip on 27 October 1839.
This voyage to Melbourne from Scotland in 1839 with the first bounty immigrants was notable and well-recorded. As she departed on 13 June 1839, John Arthur piped her out to the tune of Lochaber No More. On 15 August 1839 she pulled in to Rio de Janeiro, where she stayed ten days. She then sailed directly to Port Phillip, arriving 27 October 1839. After a stay of about 7 weeks she departed on 19 December 1839 for Bombay.


=== Convict transport ===
In 1841 David Clarke transported convicts and troops to Australia. She departed Plymouth on 7 June, under the command of William B. Mills, and arrived in Hobart on 4 October 1841. She carried 308 convicts, one of whom died on the way.
She sailed for Bombay in ballast on 17 October 1841.


=== Demise ===
Her last voyage began on 7 September 1853, when she left from Manila to London, but heavy storms forced a return to Manila. After re-caulking, she sailed again on 23 September 1853 to London via Melbourne. However, she struck a reef during a storm in the Sunda Strait and diverted to Anjer, Java, on 31 October 1853, eventually reaching Batavia on 18 November, where she was condemned. Although Lloyd's List records her sailing to Singapore on 5 June 1854, she arrived in Surabaya on that date and returned to Batavia on 17 June, where she may have been broken up.


== Legacy ==
Perhaps because of the early transport of Scots to Australia, David Clark has been commemorated several times. A reunion of passengers in 1939 was extensively recorded in newspapers, while a ceremony marked the 175th anniversary in 2014. Passenger lists for the 1839 voyage are available.

During the First Anglo-Burmese War she became the first steam-powered warship of the Honourable East India Company to see action. She was transferred to the Burmese Government in 1826 and to back to the company for use by Singapore in 1837.


== Construction ==

She was built by Kyds of Kidderpore, Calcutta as a 133-ton merchant vessel with two 16 horsepower (12 kW) side-lever engines manufactured by Henry Maudslay of Lambeth. She was launched on 12 July 1823 and purchased by the Bengal Government at the suggestion of Commander Frederick Marryat. She was armed with Congreve rockets.


== First Anglo–Burmese War ==
The Honourable East India Company used her for riverine service in the First Anglo–Burmese War. In May 1824 she accompanied the 18-gun Cruizer-class brig-sloop HMS Sophie, the 20-gun HMS Larne and the 50-gun HMS Liffey, from Port Cornwallis in the Andaman Islands to Rangoon, where she participated in an attack. Thereafter, she participated in operations against Penang on 19 September 1824.
In 1825 and 1826 she was under the command of Lieutenant George Winsor, who sailed her with the flotilla operating against the Burmese. While she was operating in the Irrawaddy River, Winsor made a map.


== Burma and Singapore ==
The war ended on 8 March 1826 and in that year she was transferred to the Burmese Government. Although one reference says she was broken up in 1836, most assert that she was sold to Singapore.
Diana steamed to Singapore on 28 February 1836. Johnston & Co. advertised her for sale. The East India Company purchased her in March 1837 and appointed Samuel Congalton her captain. Diana's establishment consisted of her captain, two European officers and thirty Malays. In the East India Company's service Diana suppressed piracy and conducted maritime surveys. Congalton remained her captain until 1845 when he became captain of her replacement, the Hooghly. Diana appears to have been sold off and renamed Eliza Penelope.

On her third trip she was sailing to India to remain there when she was wrecked on 17 July 1755 at Bird Island in Algoa Bay, near present-day Port Elizabeth. The ship was carrying a hoard of gold belonging to Clive of India, which modern treasure hunters looted. The controversy over these depredations resulted in changes to international maritime treaties to better protect underwater cultural heritage.

Voyage #1 (1748–49)
Captain Benjamin Mason left the Downs on 8 June 1748, bound for Bombay and China. Doddington the Cape on 15 September, Cochin on 5 February 1749, and Tellicherry on 20 February, and arrived at Bombay on 28 March. She was again at 1 May Tellicherry on 1 May. From there she reached Kedah on 10 June and Malacca on 11 July, and arrived at Whampoa on 9 August. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar, about 20 miles before Whampoa, on 4 December, reached Saint Helena on 3 March 1750, and arrived at Long Reach on 21 May.
Voyage #2 (1752–54)
Captain Norton Hutchinson left the Downs on 20 March 1752, bound for Bombay and Mokha. Doddington reached Lisbon on 10 April and St Augustine's Bay on 3 August. She arrived at Bombay on 9 October. She then spent the period 22 October to 13 November cruising, before again arriving at Bombay on 14 November. She sailed to Surat, which she reached on 26 December. and arrived at "Scindy Road" on 9 January 1753, before returning to Surat on 19 February. On 26 February she arrived at Bombay again. She reached Mangalore on 11 March and Tellicherry on 17 March, and arrived at Mokha on 16 April. By 16 September she was back at Bombay. From there she reached the Cape on 14 February 1754 and St Helena on 17 March, and arrived at Gravesend on 31 May.


== Wrecking ==
The Doddington sailed from Dover on 22 April 1755 bound to Fort St George in India under the command of Captain James Sampson in the company of the Stretham (carrying Clive of India), Pelham, Edgecote, and Houghton. The ships were separated en route to Porto Praya, but re-united again at the port where they all stopped to take on provisions. On 27 May 1755, the three ships departed the Cape Verde islands together, but were once again separated after the master of the Doddington took a more southerly route than the other ships. After seven weeks, the ship rounded the Cape of Good Hope. After sailing eastwards for a day, the ship was on a heading of East-North-East, when at 1 am she struck a rock in Algoa Bay.

Of the original crew and passengers of 270, only 23 initially survived while the other 247 passengers and crew died with the ship. The castaways subsisted for seven months on fish, birds and eggs on a nearby island, which they named Bird Island. One of their number, a carpenter, was able to help them make them a sloop, the Happy Deliverance, on which they were finally able to get off the island on 16 February 1756. The sloop was seaworthy enough to take the survivors on an eventful journey up the east coast of Africa via St Lucia and Delagoa Bay, where the survivors sold her before travelling on to India. Captain Norton Hutchinson, now captain of the East Indiaman Carnarvon, took them on board and carried them to Madras.


== Salvage ==
The ship was carrying a consignment of gold and silver, known as "Clive of India's Gold", which was controversially looted in recent times by Port Elizabeth treasure hunters. A third of the 1,200 gold coins were eventually returned to South Africa after a four-year legal wrangle in London. The high profile court case highlighted various shortcomings in both South African and international maritime law. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation monitored the case closely, as it set an important precedent for the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage that it subsequently published.


== Cultural ripple ==
In September 1867, at the Theatre Royal, The Dramatic Club of Port Elizabeth staged a locally written play "Treasure at Woody Cape", dealing with the legend of the Doddington's treasure.

Anecdotes of ShipwreckEarl Spencer was an East Indiaman, launched in 1795 for the British East India Company (EIC). She made seven voyages for the EIC until in 1811-12 the government took her up to transport convicts to Australia in 1813. On her return voyage from Australia she sailed via China, where she carried a cargo back to England for the EIC.


== EIC voyages ==
As most of her voyages took place during wartime, Earl Spencer frequently sailed under a letter of marque that authorized her to engage in offensive actions against the French, not just defensive. When the vessel changed masters, a new letter was issued. Also, the outbreak of war after a period of piece also required a new letter.


=== EIC voyage #1 (1795-96) ===
Captain Thomas Denton left The Downs on 26 September 1795, bound for Bengal. His letter of marque had been issued on 5 September. On 20 Feb 1796 Earl Spencer reached Kedgeree. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 3 April, reached False Bay on 12 August and the Cape on 4 September. She arrived at Crookhaven on 27 November and Long Reach on 16 December.


=== EIC voyage #2 (1797-99) ===
Captain Charles Raitt left Portsmouth on 5 June 1797 for Madras and Bengal. He had a letter of marque issued on 13 March 1797. Earl Spencer reached Simons Bay on 4 September and Madras on 2 December. She arrived at Kedgeree on 26 January 1798. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 20 April, Simons Bay on 22 August, the Cape on 30 September, and St Helena on 17 November. She arrived at The Downs on 3 February 1799.


=== EIC voyage #3 (1800-01) ===
Captain Charles Raitt left Portsmouth on 28 June 1800, bound for Bengal. Earl Spencer arrived at Kedgeree on 8 January 1801. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 7 April and St Helena of 4 August. She arrived at the Downs on 1 November.


=== EIC voyage #4 (1803-05) ===
Charles Raitt was again captain of Earl Spencer on her third voyage. The Napoleonic Wars having broken out after the one year of peace following the Treaty of Amiens, he received a new letter of marque on 8 June 1803. Raitt left Portsmouth on 30 June 1803, bound for Bengal. Earl Spencer reached Rio de Janeiro on 16 September and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 11 February 1804. She was at Saugor on 26 April, and Madras on 16 August, before reaching St Helena on 31 December. She arrived at The Downs on 19 March 1805.


=== EIC voyage #5 (1806-07) ===
A change of captain meant a new letter of marque. Captain George Heming received a letter of marque on 21 July 1806. He sailed from Portsmouth on 9 August, bound for Bombay. Earl Spencer reached Rio de Janeiro on 13 November, the Cape on 15 January 1807, and Colombo on 5 April. She arrived at Bombay on 21 May. Homeward bound, she was at the Cape on 11 October, reached St Helena on 24 October, and arrived at the Downs on 29 December.


=== EIC voyage #6 (1808-10) ===
Captain George Heming sailed from Portsmouth on 10 June 1808, bound for Madras and Bengal. Earl Spencer was at Madeira on 24 June, and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 16 November. On the way she rescued all of the passengers and all but 16 of the crew of the Travers, which had hit a rock on 7 November at 15°38′N 94°20′E.
On 2 January 1809 Earl Spencer was at Calcutta. There Heming joined three other captains of East Indiamen in a letter of protest against the Royal Navy's impressment of seamen from the ships; Earl Spencer had lost 23 men, including some petty officers, out of her crew of 87 men to the Navy. Earl Spencer was at Saugor on 14 March, Penang on 4 June, and St Helena on 14 November. She arrived at the Downs on 19 January 1810.


=== EIC voyage #7 (1810-11) ===
Captain George Heming left Portsmouth on 9 June 1810 bound for Bengal. Earl Spencer reached Madeira on 25 June and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 12 December. HMS Leda escorted the Indiamen on the voyage, and on their arrival at Kedgeree on 15 December, Captain George Sayer, captain of Leda, wrote a letter of commendation for Heming and his officers for their conduct on the voyage. On 3 February 1811 Earl Spencer was at Saugor, and on 20 February she was at Madras. She reached St Helena on 16 June and arrived at The Downs on 30 August.
The government then took up Earl Spencer to transport convicts to Australia.


== Convict transport and EIC voyage #8 ==
Under the command of William Mitchell, Earl Spencer left England on 2 June 1813. She sailed via Madeira, escorted for the early part of the voyage by HMS Kangaroo, and arrived at Port Jackson on 9 October 1813. She transported 200 male convicts, four of whom died on the voyage. An officer and 38 men of the 73rd Regiment of Foot provided the guards for the prisoners. Some 20 free settlers came too as passengers. Aboard the ship was the first steam engine brought out to Australia.
Earl Spencer left Port Jackson bound for China, but there is no date given. Between her arrival in New South Wales and her departure for China, she engaged in whaling.
Earl Spenser arrived at Whampoa anchorage on 23 October 1814. She passed the Bocca Tigris on 12 November, reaching the Cape on 26 March 1815, and St Helena on 24 April. From there she sailed "towards England" on 20 June.


== Fate ==
Last listing in Lloyd's Review for Earl Spencer was in 1820, with the listing unchanged from 1813.

Essex (1716 EIC ship) — of 320 tons (bm), launched on the Thames in 1716; made four voyages for the EIC before she was sold.
Essex (1744 EIC ship) — of 570 tons (bm), launched by Brondson & Wells, Deptford, on 17 April 1744, in November 1780; she made four voyages for the EIC until 17 September 1755 when she was sold at Lloyd's Coffee House to breakers who promptly stripped her and broke her up.
Essex (1758 ship) — of 632 tons (bm), launched by Graves, Limehouse, on 3 August 1758; made four voyages for the EIC before she was sold for breaking up in 1770.
Essex (1780 EIC ship) - of 79914⁄94 tons (bm), launched in October 1780 by Perry, Blackwell; she made five voyages for the EIC and was sold in 1798 to be hulked or broken up. She was present at the battle of Porto Praya and participated in the action of 10 September 1782. John Strover, master, received a letter of marque on 20 November 1793 for the Essex, ship, 793 tons. Her armament was described as consisting of twenty-six 4 and 9-pounder guns.
Essex (1803 EIC ship) - of 125730⁄94 tons (bm), launched on 7 February 1803 by Perry, Blackwell; she made seven voyages for the EIC until on 20 August 1821 her register was cancelled as she had been demolished. She was reputed to have had the greatest spread of sail of any East Indiaman. George Bonham received a letter of marque on 27 May 1803 for the Essex, ship, of 1352 tons (bm). Her armament was described as consisting of twenty-six 18-pounder guns and ten 18-pounder carronades. Her next master, Richard Nisbet, received a letter of marque on 16 November 1813. This time her armament was described as thirty-six 18-pounder guns.

(London: Black, Parry, and Kingsbury).Experiment was launched in 1798 at Stockton-on-Tees, England. In 1803 she transported convicts to Port Jackson. In 1805, on her way home the French captured her, but the British recaptured her. In 1808 she became a West Indiaman.


== Convict voyage and capture (1803-1805) ==
Under the command of Francis J. Withers, Experiment sailed from Cowes, England on 4 December 1803. She sailed under a letter of marque issued to "Francis McWither" on 4 October 1803.
She left in company with Coromandel, which was also carrying convicts to Port Jackson. While sailing in the Bay of Biscay (or 16 leagues from the Isles of Scilly, Experiment sprang her bowsprit and had her main top gallant mast carried away, during a gale. She limped back to Cowes to repair the damage and after repairs were affected, she sailed again on 2 January 1804. She arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 8 March and left on 8 April. She arrived at Port Jackson on 12 June 1804.
Experiment embarked two male and 136 female convicts. Six female convicts died on the voyage.
Experiment left Port Jackson on 7 October bound for China.
While Experiment was homeward passage from China to London, carrying a cargo of tea, the French privateer Napoleon, of Saint-Malo captured her. Napoleon encountered Experiment on 27 May 1805 at 37°0′S 22°30′E and captured her after a 30-hour chase. Napoleon, which was under the command of Captain Malo le Nourville, was heavily armed. She had sixteen 32-pounder and four 18-pounder guns on the main deck, and two 36-pounder on 6-pounder guns on the upper deck. She also had a crew of 200 men. After an engagement of half-an-hour, Experiment had three men badly wounded, her tiller shot away, some 32 shot between wind and water, and two feet of water in her hold. Withers therefor struck her flag. Napoleon was four months out of False Bay and Experiment was her first prize. The French sent Withers, the surgeon, and the Fourth Officer to Île de France in Experiment. Napoleon then took the remaining officers and the purser to the Cape of Good Hope. There they were able to arrange for a cartel to take them to St Helena.
On 3 August 1805, HMS Calcutta, under the command of Captain Woodriff, left St Helena as escort of a motley convoy to England. The convoy consisted of the East India company's "extra-ship" Indus, from Madras, the southern whaler African from Desolation, the whaler Fox from the Mozambique channel, the whaler Grand Sachem from the Peruvian coast and bound to Milford, the Prussian ship Wilhelmina, which Calcutta had detained on her way out to St Helena, and the large Swedish ship Carolina, which was sailing from China and asked to join. The men from Experiment sailed on African.
On 26 September the convoy encountered Allemand's squadron. Woodriff succeeded in drawing the French away from the convoy, but at the cost of his ship, which the French captured.
Apparently the French eventually sent Experiment into Cape Town. There, the British retook her, as her captors did not know that the British had occupied the Cape.

In 1808 Barkworth & Co., Hull, purchased her for use as a West Indiaman. She first reappears in Lloyd's Register for 1809 with T. Forest, master, and trade London-Cuba.

Built in India to the Present Time .... (Scott). (Google eBook)HMS Glatton was a 56-gun fourth rate of the Royal Navy. She was launched as the Glatton, an East Indiaman, on 29 November 1792 by Wells & Co. of Blackwell. The Royal Navy bought her in 1795 and converted her into a warship. Glatton was unusual in that for a time she was the only ship-of-the-line the Royal Navy armed exclusively with carronades. (Eventually she returned to a more conventional armament.) She served in the North Sea and the Baltic, and then as a transport for convicts to Australia. She then returned to naval service in the Mediterranean. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Admiralty converted her to a water depot at Sheerness. In 1830 the Admiralty converted Glatton to a breakwater and sank her at Harwich.


== East India Company service ==
In 1793-4 Glatton made one round trip to China for the East India Company. Her captain was Charles Drummond and her First Lieutenant was William Macnamarra. Drummond had commanded an earlier Glatton and would command a later one too; Macnamarra too would go on to command a later Glatton on a trip to China for the Company.
Glatton's letter of marque was dated 22 August 1793. The letter of marque permitted her, while under Drummond's command, to assist in the capture of the French brig Le Franc. It was issued after Glatton had left Portsmouth on 22 May 1793. Glatton was part of a convoy that also included the East Indiamen Prince William, Lord Thurlow, William Pitt, Barwell, Earl of Oxford, Osterley, Fort William, London, Pigot, Houghton, Marquis of Landsdown, Hillsborough, Ceres, and Earl of Abergavenny, amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.
From Portsmouth, Glatton reached Manilla on 10 November, and then Whampoa two weeks later. On her return voyage, she crossed Second Bar on 17 February 1794, reached St Helena on 18 June, and Long Reach by 12 September.
The next East Indiaman Glatton, also sailing with a letter of marque, captured a Dutch prow in the Straits of Flores in 1796, and the ship Copenhagen in 1799.


== Fitting out for Royal Navy service ==
Captain Henry Trollope commissioned her in April 1795 and he was responsible for arranging that her original armament consisted entirely of carronades instead of the standard mix of long guns and carronades that other warships carried. His previous command, some eight years earlier, had been the 44-gun Rainbow, which too had been armed entirely with carronades. With her Trollope had in 1782 taken the Hébé, which the British would go to use as the model for the Leda-class frigates.
Carronades had short, relatively thin barrels and so were half the weight of the equivalent cannon. They did not need as large gun crews and could also fire much heavier shot for their weight than a gun of the same overall weight, but at the cost of the accuracy, velocity and range of the shot. This extremely heavy armament meant that the fourth rate Glatton could discharge a heavier broadside than the first rate Victory. But, in combat Glatton would have to endure the fire of the enemy's long guns while closing the gap to point-blank range before she could effectively return fire — if indeed the enemy would allow her to approach so close.
Glatton was originally armed with twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower deck and twenty-eight 42-pounder carronades on her upper deck. All were non-recoil, which is to say that they were fixed to the deck. Within a month 32-pounder carronades replaced the 42-pounders. However, Glatton's ports were too small to allow the larger guns to traverse properly, and she had no bow or stern chasers. Her guns therefore could only be pointed straight out the side. The month after the action in July 1796 (see below), she received two 32-pounders and two 18-pounder carronades for her forecastle. Later, the Navy replaced the twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower deck with twenty-eight 18-pounder long guns, ending the experiment.
Trollope was extremely happy with Glatton's seaworthiness, handling and general fitting out. He wrote to John Wells, the shipbuilder and her former owner, "I sincerely hope... we may meet with a seventy four in the Glatton...she would either take her or sink her in twenty minutes."


== North Sea and Baltic ==

Under Trollope, Glatton first served in the English Channel where she engaged a French squadron on 15 July 1796. The French squadron consisted of a 50-gun ship, five frigates (two of 36 guns and three of 28), a brig, and a cutter. Glatton drove the French vessels into Flushing, having lost only two men wounded, one of whom died later, and despite having at times been surrounded by the enemy and exchanging fire at less than 20 yards. The French vessels may have included Brutus (a 74-gun cut down to 46-50 guns), Incorruptible (50 guns), Magicienne (32 guns), and Républicaine, and one French vessel apparently sank in Flushing harbour. (It was in this action that Captain Strangeways of the Royal Marines sustained the wound of which he died shortly thereafter, and which the illustration above commemorates.)
In March–April 1797, Trollope kept Glatton's crew from joining the Nore mutiny. By threatening to fire on the 64-gun Overyssel and the 40-gun Beaulieu, which were in open mutiny, he convinced their crews to return to duty. In August Captain Charles Cobb took command.
In April and May 1798 Glatton participated, with many other vessels, in the capture of sundry Dutch doggers, schuyts, and fishing vessels. On 4 and 5 May Glatton was among the vessels that captured 12 outward-bound Greenland ships. The other vessels included the hired armed cutters Fox and Marshall Coburg, though most were much larger and included Monmouth, Ganges, Director, America, among others. On 28 May Glatton, Monarch, Ganges, America, Veteran, Belliqueux, Director, Apollo, the hired armed cutters Fox the First and Rose when they captured the Janus. All the British vessels were part of the fleet under the command of Admiral Lord Duncan. Next, many of the same vessels, including Glatton, Prosperine, Fox the First and Rose, captured several more Dutch vessels:
Hoop (6 June);
Stadt Embden (11 June);
Neptune (12 June);
Rose and Endrast (14 June);
Hoop (15 June); and
Vrow Dorothea (l6 June).
On 18 August 1798, Glatton, Veteran, Belliqueux, Monmouth, Kent, Ganges, Prince Frederick, Diomede, the sloop Busy, and the hired armed cutter Rose captured the Adelarde.
Glatton was with other ships from Duncan's fleet, including Astraea, Scorpion, Cruizer, and the hired armed lugger Rover, and cutters Liberty and Hazard, when they captured the Harmenie on 21 April 1799. Glatton was in company with Kent, Romney, Isis and Ranger when they captured the Dutch hoy Johanna on 16 May 1799.
Then in August 1799, Glatton participated in the Anglo-Russian Invasion of Holland. The expedition was under the command of Admiral Adam Duncan and the Duke of York. Some 250 craft of all sizes transported 17,000 troops from Margate Roads and the Downs across the Channel on 13 August. Due to bad weather it was 21 August before they anchored off Kijkduin. The next day Vice Admiral Mitchell sent a summons to Vice Admiral Samuel Story, calling on him to surrender his fleet. When he declined, the Duke of York landed his army near Den Helder on 27 August under covering fire from the fleet. Den Helder was occupied the following day when the garrison evacuated the town. The expedition then took possession of 13 old warships laid up in ordinary. On 30 August, Glatton, Romney, Isis, Veteran, Ardent, Belliqueux, Monmouth and Overyssel, the Russian ship Mistisloff and the frigates, anchored in line ahead in the Vlieter and Mitchel again summoned Story. This time Story agreed to surrender his squadron of 12 modern warships. The Royal Navy purchased 11 of these. The Dutch surrender, without any resistance, became known as the Vlieter Incident. As a result of the surrender, Duncan's fleet was awarded prize money, in which Glatton shared.
On 15 January 1800 a court martial on board the Glatton, in Yarmouth Roads, tried the surviving officers and crew for the loss on the Cockle Sands of the 12-gun brig Mastif as she left Yarmouth Roads via the Northern Passage for Leith. Her captain, Lieutenant James Watson, and eight of his crew had been lost in the incident. The court absolved the accused for the loss of the vessel.
In November, Captain George Stephen took command of Glatton, followed in 1801 by Captain William Bligh, formerly of HMS Bounty. Bligh was only captain for about a month, but during that month he sailed her to the Baltic where Glatton participated in the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The battle cost her 17 killed and 34 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty would award the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Copenhagen 1801" to all surviving claimants from the action.
Glatton was next under Captain William Nowell and then under Captain William Birchall. In August 1801 she was fitted at Sheerness for a guardship in protected waters. Captain John Ferris Devonshire took command that same month.


== Convict transport to Australia ==
Captain Nathaniel Porlock recommissioned her in May 1802 as a convict ship. Next, Commander James Colnett assumed command and on 23 September Glatton left England, carrying over 270 male, and 135 female prisoners; of these, seven men and five women died on the journey. She also carried some 30 Free Settlers. She sailed via a resupply stop at Rio de Janeiro to the penal settlement at Sydney, where she arrived on 13 March 1803. When Glatton arrived about 100 of the people on board her were suffering to varying degrees from scurvy.
She then returned to England, arriving on 22 September 1803, that is, after an absence of 364 days. Because she returned via Cape Horn, she had circumnavigated the world; her actual time at sea for this transit was 277 days.


== Return to naval service ==
Between November and December 1803 she was refitted at Woolwich for service as a man-of-war. Still under Colnett's command, she then served briefly as flagship for Rear Admiral James Vashon.
In 1804 Glatton was reduced to a 44-gun fifth rate. On 11 November she, together with Eagle, Majestic, Princess of Orange, Raisonable, Africiane, Inspector, Beaver the hired armed cutter Swift and the hired armed lugger Agnes, shared in the capture of the Upstalsboom, H.L. De Haase, Master.
Captain Thomas Seccombe recommissioned Glatton in March 1806 and sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 November. On 19 February 1807, Glatton captured the Turkish vessels San Giovanni Pidomias and Codro Mariolo. That same day Glatton and Hirondelle captured the San Michelle. Four days later, Hirondelle captured the vessel Madonna, with Glatton sharing by agreement. On 26 February Hirondelle captured the San Nicollo, and Glatton again shared by agreement.
On 1 March, boats from Glatton and Hirondelle cut out a former French corvette in Turkish service from the port of Sigri on the island of Mitylene. The vessel was pierced for 18 guns but only 10 were mounted. The British boarding party lost five officers and men killed and nine men wounded.
The next day Glatton and Hirondelle captured three other Turkish vessels, names unknown but with masters, Statio, Constantine and Papeli. On 4 March Glatton and Hirondelle captured another Turkish vessel. One week later, Glatton captured yet another Turkish vessel, name unknown, Ibrahim, Master.
Then on 29 November Glatton captured several transports off Corfu that were transferring troops from Otranto to Corfu. Glatton removed some 300 troops before she destroyed the nine vessels they had been on. Two vessels escaped back to Otranto.
Glatton and the brig-sloop Delight had received information that the French had captured four Sicilian gunboats and taken them into Scylla, near Reggio, Calabria. On 31 January 1808, as Delight approached the port, a strong current pushed her towards the shore and she grounded. Seccombe went on board Delight to supervise the recovery effort. As they were trying to free Delight, her boats and those of Glatton came under intense fire from the shore. They were unsuccessful in freeing Delight, and Delight's captain, Commander Phillip Crosby Handfield, late of Egyptienne, and many of his crew were killed. Although the crew took to the boats, not all were able to escape and a number of the men on her, including Seccombe, became prisoners of war. The French paroled Seccombe, who had been severely wounded, to Messina, where he died on 3 February 1808.
Glatton came under the command of Commander Henry Hope (acting) and in March 1808 under Commander Charles Irving (acting). Captain George Miller Bligh then took command around December. He brought a convoy home from Malta in July and then sailed her to Sheerness for laying up in October. She sailed briefly to the Baltic in 1811.


== Fate ==
From 1812 to 1814 Glatton was under R. G. Peacock (master) at Portsmouth. In 1814 she was converted to serve as a water depot at Sheerness. Between April and June 1830 she was fitted at Sheerness as a breakwater, and in October Glatton sailed for the last time, to Harwich, where she was subsequently sunk.

She made two trips for the British East India Company (EIC), and was homeward bound from the second of these when the French privateer Napoleon captured her off the Cape of Good Hope.


== Career ==
On 20 August 1801 Captain Luckyn Betts received a letter of marque for Hercules. He then sailed from Ireland on 29 November 1801, and arrived at Port Jackson on 26 June 1802. Hercules had sailed via Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope, which she reached on 12 April 1802. In Ireland she had embarked 140 male and 25 female convicts. Forty-four male convicts died on the voyage.
Hercules left Port Jackson on 12 August bound for China. By 26 October she was at Whampoa. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar - about 20 miles before Whampoa — on 3 January 1803, reached St Helena on 14 April, and arrived at The Downs on 19 June.
For her next voyage Hercules received a new master, and so required a new letter of marque, if he wanted one. Richard Rabeg? received his letter of marque on 8 October 1803.


== Geography ==

As Hercules was returning to England from Bombay, the French privateer Napoleon captured her off Cape Agulhas and sent her into Port Louis. At her capture, Hercules was carrying a cargo of cotton.. In November 1805, Napoleon brought the prisoners from Hercules and from the whaler Diamond into the Cape Colony, then in Dutch hands. There Alex Tennant, resident in the Cape, arranged at his own expense, for the prisoners to be sent to St Helena, where they arrived in January 1806.

She was a large vessel of 1,463 tons (bm), launched in 1796 to replace a previous Hindostan that the Royal Navy had bought and turned into a Fourth Rate ship of the line. Her owner was Robert Williams, M.P., who had been the owner of the previous Hindostan.
She made three complete voyages. She was lost on her fourth voyage, wrecking at Margate in January 1803.


== Voyages ==
As was typical for East Indiamen during wartime, Hindostan made her voyages under a letter of marque, which authorized her to capture enemy vessels should the opportunity arise.
First voyage
Under Captain William Mackintosh she sailed to Bombay and China. Before leaving, she had the misfortune to run over the Thomas and Alice in Blackwell Reach, sinking the smaller ship. Hindostan left for the Far East on 18 March 1797, via Bombay, Cochin, and Malacca, before arriving at Whampoa on 8 January 1798. For the return voyage she crossed Second Bar on 3 March, reached Saint Helena on 5 August, and the Downs on 18 October, finally anchoring on 22 October 1798.
Mackintosh had made five earlier voyages for the East India Company, including three as captain of Indiamen. In 1792-94 he was captain of a different Hindostan when he took George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney on Britain's first embassy to China. Mackintosh's letter of marque was dated 7 February 1797.
Second voyage
Under Captain George Millett she sailed to China, leaving Portsmouth on 18 June 1799. On the way out she reached Penang on 28 October and Whampoa on 16 January 1800. On her return trip, she reached Anger on 3 May, Saint Helena on 15 July, and the Downs on 23 September.
Because her captain had changed, Hindostan required a new letter of marque; Millett's was dated 15 April 1799. It would remain valid for his subsequent voyages as well.
Third Voyage
For her third voyage Hindostan was again under Captain George Millet. This was his eighth voyage for the East India Company, and his fifth as a captain. She sailed to the Coast and China, leaving Portsmouth on 31 March 1801. She reached Madras on 26 July, Penang on 28 August, and Whampoa on 29 September. For her return trip she crossed Second Bar on 7 December. She reached Saint Helena on 12 April 1802 and the Downs on 10 June, before finally anchoring on 13 June.


== Wreck ==
Hondostan's fourth voyage was for the Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, the Coast and China. She carried mostly woolens and 45,000 ounces of silver bullion in 13 cases for private ventures, not the East India Company. For this voyage her captain was Edward Balston. Hindostan left London just after the turn of the new year. Unfortunately a severe gale caught her just off Margate on 11 January 1803 and wrecked her on the Wedge Sand. She had about 120 persons aboard, of whom about 20 or 25 lost their lives. On the morning of the 12th, a Margate hoy, the Lord Nelson, and the pilot sloop Liberty saved 80.

The Hindostan's cargo was valued at £100,000. Eleven of the 13 cases of bullion were salvaged. Also 100 bales of wool were salvaged. The Company abandoned the wreck on 24 January. Items from the ship are preserved at Whitstable museum.

== Loss ==
For her sixth voyage, Johanna was under the command of Captain Robert Brown. She left the Downs on 24 February 1682, and wrecked near the Cape Agulhas on 8 June 1682, while in a convoy to India with four other ships. Ten persons lost their lives, while the remaining 104 were able to make their way to Cape Town.


== Post-script ==
A considerable amount of gold was on board. Dutch East India Company governor of the Cape Simon van der Stel immediately recovered some of it. Three hundred years later, in 1982, treasure hunters salvaged a further 23,000 coins and several hundred kilograms of silver.

"The Johanna 1682 (Joanna)" at shipwreck.co.zaKent, launched in 1799, was an East Indiaman of the British East India Company. On her first voyage in 1800 she was on her way to Bengal and Bencoolen when the French privateer Robert Surcouf captured her near the mouth of the Ganges.


== Capture ==
Kent left Torbay on 3 May 1800. She was under the command of Robert Rivington, who sailed under a letter of marque dated 28 March 1800. At St. Salvador, she took on 300 persons, including troops and passengers, the survivors of the East Indiaman Queen, which had caught fire there and been destroyed, with in excess of 100 fatalities. Queen and Kent had left Torbay on the same day.
On 7 October Kent encountered the French privateer brig Confiance, of 18 guns and 150 men, under the command of Robert Surcouf.
French account
At some point Kent had rescued the crew and passengers of another ship, destroyed by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement. Including passengers, among whom there were some 100 soldiers, she had 437 persons aboard. Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and seize control of Kent. The British had 14 men killed, including Rivington, and 44 wounded, while the French suffered five men killed and ten wounded.
British account

James reports that Kent fought for almost two hours and that Rivington was killed by a shot to the head as the French boarded. He states that Kent's armament consisted of twenty 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders on her castles, and that Confiance' armament consisted of 20-22 long 8-pounder guns. He speculates that if Kent had carried 18 or 24-pounder carronades instead of the long 6-pounders, she might have been able to use grapeshot to deter boarding. He further reports that in addition to her crew of 100 or so, she had some 38 male and three female passengers, including seven or eight passengers that she had picked up at St. Salvador, after a fire there had destroyed the Indiaman Queen on 9 July. Apparently some four or five passengers were among the British dead, and there were also passengers among the wounded. James attributes the crew being overwhelmed by the boarders to a shortage of swords, pikes and pistols.
Another account estimates the number of persons on Kent as under 200, and gives the casualties as 11 killed and 44 wounded on the British side, and 16 wounded (of whom three later died), on the French side. The passengers included General St. John, his wife, three daughters, two other women, and St. John's aide, Captain Pilkington, who had been wounded. Surcouf put them into a passing Arab merchantman and they arrived shortly thereafter in Calcutta.
Aftermath
Surcouf put his first officer, Joachim Drieux, aboard Kent, together with a 60-man prize crew. Surcouf released the passengers on a merchantman that he stopped a few days later. Confiance and Kent arrived at the Rade des Pavillons in Port Louis, Mauritius, in November. The capture of Kent became a sensation, and the British Admiralty promised a reward for the capture of Surcouf.
Kent was sold for 30,900 piastres to a Danish shipping company and renamed Cronberg. She left on 21 March, but as she approached Denmark passing vessels informed her that a British fleet had attacked Copenhagen ; she therefore waited some weeks in Fleckeroë before it was safe to proceed to arrived in Kristiansand in June 1801, and at Copenhagen on 16 July.

She was launched in 1743 and made five trips for the company before the EIC sold her in 1751.


== EIC voyages ==
EIC voyage #1 (1743-45)
Capt Henry Watts sailed from Plymouth on 16 November 1743, bound for Bengal and Benkulen. Lapwing reached the Cape on 14 February 1744, and Madras on 26 April. On 25 May she arrived at Rogues River,a section of the Hooghly River. On 24 October she was at Calcutta. Outward bound, she was at Rogues River again on 17 November, reaching Benkulen on 9 January 1745. Homeward bound, she reached St Helena on 5 April and Galway on 17 September, before arriving at The Downs on 20 December.
EIC voyage #2 (1745-46)
Captain Francis Cheyne (or Chene) sailed Lapwing to Holland and return between 18 March 1745 and September 1746.
EIC voyage #3 (1746-47)
Captain Cheyne sailed Lapwing to Madras and back between 9 November 1746 and 21 November 1747. Lapwing was carrying 25 tons of lead, 50 chests of "treasure" and "a recruit of soldiers". Around 15 May 1747 Lapwing was to sail from Madras via Sumatra, where she was to deliver 200 bales (probably broadcloth, but type unspecified, hence understood), and pick up a full cargo of pepper.
EIC voyage #4
Madras and Bengal. Captain Cheyne sailed from Portsmouth on 24 February 1748, bound for Madras and Bengal. Lapwing reached Fort St. David on 21 June. She delayed her departure for Bengal because of a report of there being a French squadron of eight vessels in the area. On 26 August she was off Madagascar, but returned to Fort St David on 3 October. She arrived at Calcutta on 27 November. Homeward bound, she was at Ingeli, a point on the west side of the Hooghli Estuary, on 30 December. She reached Fort St David on 9 January 1749 Fort St David, and St Helena on 18 March, before arriving at The Downs on 1 June.
EIC voyage #5 (1749-51)
Captain Cheyne left The Downs 6 September 1749, bound for Madras and Bengal. Lapwing reached Fort St David on 17 January 1750. When she arrived she had lost 16 men on the voyage, and the rest of the crew was weak from scurvy. She left on 30 January with 80 chests of her silver, coined into rupees. However, it turned out that at Fort St David the 80 chests of bullion had been coined into 90 chests of "Arcot rupees", but only 80 chests were forwarded to Bengal, ten being improperly retained at Fort St David.
Lapwing arrived at Calcutta on 5 March. Homeward bound, she was at Culpee, an anchorage towards Calcutta, and just below Diamond Harbour, on 17 August. She reached Fort St David on 19 September and St Helena on 5 January 1751, before arriving at The Downs on 7 March.


== Fate ==
The EIC sold Lapwing on 17 April 1751 as being unfit for further service.

The British Royal Navy captured her on 3 February 1781 at Saint Eustatia. The Navy took her into service as HMS Mars, but sold her on 25 March 1784. Richard Bush purchased Mars, retained her name, and had her fitted as an East Indiaman. Adams repaired her and took her measurements in 1786. She sailed to China in April 1786 and was wrecked in December 1787 shortly after her return to Britain.


== Capture ==
Following the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War between Britain and the Dutch Republic Admiral George Rodney, acting under orders from London, captured the Dutch island of St Eustatius on 3 February 1781.
Mars, under the command of Captain Count Van Bijland, was the only Dutch warship in the roadstead. Because she was grossly outnumbered and outgunned, she fired only two or three pro-forma shots. Two of the British ships shot at Mars and Van Bijland then answered with his cannons. Rodney reprimanded the captains responsible for this lack of discipline.


== British Royal Navy ==
The Royal Navy commissioned Mars under Captain John Whitmore Chetwynd. He sailed her back to England as part of a fleet of prizes and other ships. She arrived at Portsmouth on 28 June 1781, and was paid off at Chatham in August. The Navy completed her survey there on 12 February 1782. It sold her on 25 March 1784 for £505.


== East Indiaman ==
Richard Bush purchased her and had Mars refitted by Adams as an East Indiaman.
Under the command of Captain William Farington (or Farrington), she left The Downs on 26 April 1786, bound for China as an "extra" ship for the EIC. Mars arrived at Whampoa on 11 December. She crossed the Second Bar on 22 March 1787, and was at Mew Bay (some two miles east of Tanjung Layar), by 11 May. She arrived at Mauritius on 15 June, and left on 4 August. By 21 September she was at St Helena, which she left on 2 October. Mars arrived at The Downs on 8 December, but was lost on the Margate Sands the next day. The pilot made an error that resulted in her stranding. The cost of the loss was £70,000.

In 1799 she transported convicts from Ireland to Australia. On this voyage she was under charter to the (EIC). From Australia she sailed to Bengal, and then back to Britain. She underwent repairs in 1802 and then traveled to St Helena and Bengal for the EIC.


== EIC voyage #1 (1796-98) ==
Captain Thomas Blany (or Blamey) sailed Minerva from Southampton on 22 May 1796, bound for Bengal. She reached Gibraltar on 14 June, Santa Cruz de Tenerife on 8 July, and the Cape on 19 September. She arrived at Diamond Harbour on 10 February 1797. Homeward bound, she left Calcutta on 25 April, passed Diamond Harbour on 3 May, reached the Cape on 29 August, and reached St Helena on 29 September. She arrived at the Downs on 30 January.
Lloyd's List for 2 February reported that Minerva, Blaney, master, had run afoul of Castor, Salkeld, master, from Bengal, in The Downs. Castor was on shore at Ramsgate, and the cargo was expected to be saved.


== Convict transport and EIC voyage #2 (1799-1801) ==
Under the command of Joseph Salkeld (or Stalkeld), Minerva left the Downs, on 6 August 1799. She sailed from Cork, Ireland on 24 August with 165 male and 26 female convicts, plus three children belonging to convicts. She also had a detachment of 20 men from the New South Wales Marine Corps to guard the prisoners, and several passengers. One passenger was Joseph Holt, was had been general for the United Irish, and who had led a large guerrilla force that had fought against British troops in County Wicklow from June–October 1798. A second passenger was Henry Fulton, who was a clergyman in the Diocese of Killaloe, and who also had been involved in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Both men travelled to Australia with their families, all sharing a cabin. They were not convicts per se. Holt was among seven transportees who had agreed to self-exile in lieu of punishment. Fulton may have been numbered the 70 men classified as political prisoners. A third notable passenger was Captain William Cox, who had been appointed paymaster of the New South Wales Corps.
Minerva sailed in company with Friendship and some other vessels. On 14 September, Minerva parted from Friendship, and their escort, HMS Dryad, left them to return to Ireland. Two weeks later, on 30 September. Minerva exchanged shots at some distance with two strange vessels that sported Portuguese colors, but both sides did not pursue the matter. Three days after that Minerva encountered two Spanish vessels, a galleon and what appeared to be a prison ship. The British made ready to fight as Spain was an enemy of Britain's. The British also permitted Holt to form a gun crew from among the political prisoners, they having agreed to fight. As Minerva approached, the supposed prison ship fired a broadside. At that, Salkeld sailed away, and so did the Spaniards. Later, Holt admitted that had the Spanish boarded, he and his men would have mutinied.
Minerva reached Rio de Janeiro on 10 October and arrived at Port Jackson on 11 January 1800. She arrived there a month before Friendhip. Three male convicts died on the voyage; this was a particularly low rate for such a long voyage. Salkeld had a liberal attitude with respect to restrictions on the conduct of the female convicts and a number of marriages eventuated. Holt later credited Cox with fostering the humane treatment of the prisoners that had resulted in the low death rate, and ended up managing Cox's farm.
Minerva left Port Jackson for Bengal in April 1800. She arrived at Calcutta on 7 June. Homeward bound, she passed Kedgeree on 27 October, reached St Helena on 24 February 1801 and Ascension Island on 22 March, and arrived at the Downs on 26 May. She had travelled with several other extra ships of the EIC, viz Varuna, William Ward Farrer, master, Highland Chief, Scott, master, and Friendship. HMS Buffalo, a 12-gun storeship, had been their escort.
In 1802 Minerva changed hands, and underwent extensive repairs by Perry and at this time had her measurements taken. Her new owner was James Pycroft, and her new master became George Weltden.
Lloyd's Register


== EIC voyage #3 (1802-03 ==
Weltden left the Downs on 14 June 1802, bound for St Helena and Bengal, and in company with the East Indiaman Lord Eldon. One of the passengers on board was Henry Salt, who would later go on to become consul general in Egypt and a noted Egyptologist; he was travelling as secretary to Viscount Lord Valentia. Minerva reached Madeira around 29 June and St Helena on 20 August. From there she reached the Cape on 20 October. At the Cape she picked up the future General Vandeleur and a portion of the 8th Light Dragoons. She separated from the Lord Eldon at the Cape and reached the Nicobar Islands on 5 January 1803; she arrived at Calcutta on 29 January. On her homeward bound trip she passed Saugor on 10 March, reached the Nicobars again on 13 April, Colombo on 10 May, St Helena on 2 August, and Cork on 29 November, and arrived at the Downs on 12 December.
Minerva had left Britain during the Peace of Amiens, which broke down in March 1803. Weltden received a letter of marque dated 6 July 1803, i.e., after he had left.


== Later career ==
The 1803 Lloyd's Register notes that Minerva had a new master, one Dodds by name. The letter of marque issued on 11 October 1804 to "Dods", shows her armament as two 9-pounder guns and twelve 24-pounder carronades.
In the 1806 Lloyd's Register she is shown as travelling between London and Barbados, and armed with fourteen 24-pounder carronades. The entries continue relatively unchanged through the 1808 Lloyd's Register, and then end.

ISBN 978-0646179513HMS Monmouth was a 64-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 23 April 1796 at Rotherhithe. She had been designed and laid down for the East India Company, but the Navy purchased her after the start of the French Revolutionary War. She served at the Battle of Camperdown and during the Napoleonic Wars. Hulked in 1815, she was broken up in 1834.


== Construction and commissioning ==
Monmouth was originally being built as an East Indiaman for the East India Company under the name Belmont. In 1796 the Navy purchased five ships being built or serviced in commercial dockyards along the River Thames and had them completed as warships. Alongside Belmont, then being built at Rotherhithe by Randall & Company, the Navy acquired the merchantmen Royal Admiral, Princess Royal, Earl Talbot and Pigot; they became HMS York, HMS Ardent, HMS Agincourt and HMS Lancaster respectively. Belmont was registered and named Monmouth on 14 July 1795 and was launched on 23 April 1796, being completed by 31 October 1796 at Deptford Dockyard.


== French Revolutionary Wars ==
HMS Monmouth was commissioned in September 1796 under the command of the Captain William Carnegie, Earl of Northesk. She was initially assigned to serve in the North Sea, and in May 1797 was one of the ships involved in the Nore mutiny. The crew took her first lieutenant, Charles Bullen, prisoner and threatened to execute him. Northesk intervened and Bullen was able to carry messages from the crew that are said to have helped end the mutiny. After the mutiny Northesk resigned his commission. Order was restored in a matter of weeks, and Monmouth was placed under Commander James Walker, in an acting captaincy. Walker had been planning to attack the mutinous ships at anchor with a squadron of gunboats only a few weeks previously.
Walker commanded Monmouth at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797. Admiral Adam Duncan led the fleet to meet the Dutch.

Before the battle Walker addressed his crew, saying:

"Now, my lads, you see your enemy before you. I shall lay you close on board, and thus give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters with the blood of your foes. Go to your quarters, and do your duty."

Monmouth engaged in heavy combat with the Dutch ships Delft and Alkmaar, capturing both, although the Delft sank on the way back. In the battle Monmouth had five men killed and 22 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Camperdown" to all surviving claimants from the action.
In March 1798, Robert Deans became captain. Monmouth was among the seven vessels of Lord Duncan's fleet that shared in the prize money for the privateer Jupiter, captured on 27 April.
In January 1799 Vice-Admiral Archibald Dickson raised his flag in her, but she then went into Sheerness in March for repairs. Next month, Captain George Hart, who retained the command until 1805, replaced Deans. Then Monmouth was among the vessels sharing in the prize money from sundry Dutch doggers, schuyts, and fishing vessels, taken in April and May. Monarch was also part of a squadron that in May captured the Roose (12 May), the Genet, Polly, American, Forsigtigheid, and Bergen (all 14 May), the Des Finch (21 May), and the Vrow Dorothea (30 May).
That summer, Monmouth took part in the Helder expedition, a joint Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland under the command of Vice-Admiral Andrew Mitchell. At the Neiuw Diep the British captured seven warships and 13 Indiamen and transports. Then Mitchell obtained the surrender of a squadron of the navy of the Batavian Republic in the Vlieter Incident. The Dutch surrendered twelve vessels ranging down in size from the 74-gun Washington to the 16-gun brig Galathea. Next, Monmouth was among the vessels sharing in the capture on 17 August of the Adelarde. On 15 September Monmouth, several other British vessels and two Russian, arrived at Sheerness as escort to five Dutch ships of the line, three frigates and one sloop.
Monmouth sailed for the Mediterranean in June 1801. She therefore came to share in the proceeds of the capture of the Almas di Purgatoria off Alexandria on 28 July. Because Monmouth served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp "Egypt" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants.


== Napoleonic Wars ==
In 1803 Monmouth, still under Hart's command, was at Gibraltar. There Hart received the report of Captain John Gore of Medusa of his capture of one French felucca-rigged privateer, in the Strait, the Esperance, and the destruction of another, the Sorcier. In July Monmouth was with the Mediterranean squadron blockading Toulon. After his promotion to Rear Admiral in April 1804 Thomas McNamara Russell raised his flag in Monmouth for the North Sea.
Captain Edward Durnford King commissioned Monmouth again in March 1807. Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury raised his flag in her on 7 September and then eight days later sailed her with a convoy of nine Indiamen to the East Indies, seven for the coast and two for Bombay. The convoy was reported well on 28 November at 30°10′S 5°20′W. The vessels she was convoying included Northampton, Sarah Christiana, Ann, Union, Diana, Sir William Pulteney, and Glory.
During the voyage, on 25 January 1808 she captured the Danish ship Nancy. Then on 12 February she arrived off the Danish possession of Tranquebar just in time to observe the landing of troops of the 14th Regiment of Foot and the Honourable East India Company's artillery by Russell. The British immediately went on to capture the settlement and fort, which capitulated without resistance. Monmouth returned to Britain in September 1808, having escorted another convoy of Indiamen. She was put out of commission on 24 September.
In August 1809 Monmouth was at the Walcheren Expedition, the aim of which was to demolish the dockyards and arsenals at Antwerp, Terneuzen, and Flushing. In August Admiral Sir Richard Strachan sent her back to England for water. In October she was commissioned again under Commander Michael Dod, but as a victualing ship in the Downs.
His successor on 7 November 1810 was Captain Francis Beauman. At the time Monmouth was the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Campbell, Commander-in-Chief of the Downs station. In March Beauman presented a sword (worth 100 guineas) to Campbell on behalf of all the captains and commanders on the Downs station on the occasion of Campbell's being relieved of his command. In April 1811 Captain Hyde Parker took command of Monmouth.
From 1812 to 1813 she was under the command of Captain William Nowell. His successor was Captain William Wilkinson. Throughout this time she was also the flagship for Vice-Admiral Thomas Foley, Campbell's successor.


== Fate ==
Monmouth was laid up in ordinary at Woolwich in 1815. She then was hulked, becoming a sheer hulk at Deptford dockyard. She was broken up in 1834.

Neptune was chartered for one voyage with the British East India Company (EIC). Later, she made two voyages transporting convicts from England to Australia.


== Career ==
On her one voyage for the EIC she left Portsmouth on 6 July 1827 under the command of Captain John Altham Cumberlege, Jr., bound for Bengal. She reached Bombay on 26 October, Mangalore on 15 November, Saugor on 27 December, and arrived at Calcutta on 2 January 1828. On her return voyage she passed Kedgeree on 14 February, reached Madras on 3 March and St Helena on 18 May, and arrived at the Downs on 12 July.
On her first convict voyage, under the command of William Ferris and surgeon Joseph Steret, she departed Sheerness on the 7 October 1837 and arrived in Hobart on 18 January 1838. She transported 200 male convicts, three of whom died en route.
Neptune sailed from Cork, Ireland, on 26 October 1843, still under the command of William Ferris, and with 308 bounty emigrants aboard. She arrived in Sydney on 11 February 1844 and was placed in quarantine for three days on arrival due to smallpox. Ten people died during the voyage.
On her second convict voyage, under the command of John Henderson and with surgeon Thomas Gibson, she departed England in January 1850 and arrived in Hobart on 5 April 1850. She transported 300 male convicts, and disembarked 282 at Hobart.
In 1849 Neptune attempted to deliver 288 convicts to the Cape Colony to start a new penal settlement in South Africa. The free settlers already there vigorously opposed the idea and it was eventually abandoned.

Her first trade was as a London-based transport, with T. Ellerby as master. Her next trade was London-Jamaica, under John Dick, master. During 1801, her trade became London-Botany Bay.
Under the command of John Davison, she sailed from Spithead, England on 12 February 1802, in company with Coromandel. She reached Rio de Janeiro on 9 April, and the Cape on 25 May. At the Cape Davison purchased a number of head of cattle.
She arrived at Port Jackson on 14 August 1802. Perseus transported 113 male convicts, one of whom died on the voyage. The cattle too survived the voyage and Governor Philip Gidley King purchased them for the Government at £35 per head.
Perseus left Port Jackson on 7 October bound for China. Perseus brought with her goods loaded in London for sale at Canton.
Perseus returned to Britain on 9 August 1803. In 1804 she was converted to an armed escort ship and transport. On 10 September the "Perseus armed defense ship" sailed for Shields.
By 1809-10 Perseus was a transport operating out of Cowes. She is no longer listed in 1811.

She made six voyages for the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). On her sixth voyage, while under the command of Captain William Moffat, she captured a French 14-gun privateer. Her last voyage ended in 1802 and her subsequent fate is unknown.


== Voyages ==


=== First voyage (1786-87) ===
Captain James Rattray commanded Phoenix on her first voyage, which was to Madras and Bengal. She left the Downs on 16 January 1786. She was reported to have been well on 6 May at 17°25′S 75°40′E, and within three weeks sail of Madras. She reached Madras on 20 May and left ten days later. She then arrived at Diamond Harbour, south of Calcutta, on 13 November. On her homeward voyage, she passed Saugor on 19 December. By 3 March 1787 she was at St Helena, and she arrived at the Downs on 18 May. On her return voyage she brought with her a beautiful gray Arabian stallion whose price, including transport costs, was £1510.


=== Second voyage (1788-89) ===
For her second voyage, this one also to Bengal and Madras, Phoenix was under the command of Captain Alexander Gray, who would be her captain for her third voyage too. She left the Downs on 17 February 1788, and on 16 March was at Madeira. She reached Diamond Harbour on 19 July. She passed Saugor on 5 January 1789 and by 20 February was in Madras. From there she sailed to the Cape, which she reached on 5 May. On 10 June she was at St Helena, and on 6 August she arrived at the Downs.
On 22 September 1790, the Court of Directors of the HEIC held a secret meeting to investigate allegations that one of the directors, a John Woodhouse, had nominated Gray as captain for the voyage in return for "pecuniary consideration". The investigation came to an end when Woodhouse resigned from the Directory on 1 February 1791. However, there was no doubt that the infraction of the company's rules had occurred.


=== Third voyage (1791-92) ===
Captain Gray again sailed Phoenix to Madras and Bengal. Before leaving, Gray engaged a Scotsman, Alexander Macdonald, to ship aboard Phoenix as his servant and occasional piper.
Phoenix left the Downs on 4 Apr 1791 and reached São Tiago on 1 May. There a storm drove her out to sea and she almost wrecked on some rocks. She left on 8 May and reached Madras on 4 August. There she landed all her cargo, those of her passengers destined for that city. She also landed three officers and 220 recruits for the 72nd Regiment and 76th Regiment of Foot. On 7 August she left Madras, reaching Diamond Harbour on 13 August, where she discharged her remaining passengers. On 23 August she was at Kedgeree.
In mid-October, she took on board "450 sepoys with their officers, and a cargo of rice, paddy, gram, doll, and gee for the army on the Malabar coast." Phoenix delivered the troops and cargo at Madras towards the end of the month.
In the beginning of November she left Madras roads, but encountered a sudden squall that almost put her on her beam ends. Contrary winds prevented her from immediately reaching Diamond Harbour. She arrived there on 16 November.
On 15 December, she was at Saugor. Phoenix started to take cargo on in the middle of December and on the 25th she reached Cox's Island where she took on the last of her cargo. On 8 January 1792 she sailed for Madras, which she reached eight days later. There she took on 150 passengers and invalid soldiers. On 20 January she sailed for Britain.
Adverse winds made it difficult to pass the Cape of Good Hope, but Phoenix arrived at St Helena on 5 April. She stayed there for 12 days to take in water and fresh provisions, leaving on 16 April. On 2 June she arrived at the Downs, where she landed some her passengers, and on 7 June moored in Long Reach.


=== Fourth voyage (1794-95) ===
For her fourth voyage, this to Madras, Phoenix was under the command of Captain Wemys Orrok (or Wemyss Orrok). This voyage took place after the commencement of the French Revolutionary Wars, so the Company arranged for Phoenix to sail under a letter of marque. This was dated 14 November 1793, and still gave her captain's name as Alexander Gray. Phoenix sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May 1794 and reached Madras on 3 September. She was back at St Helena on 7 January 1795 and the Downs on 23 July.


=== Fifth Voyage (1796-99) ===
Orrok was again captain of Phoenix, sailing her to Bengal, Penang and Madras. She left Portsmouth on 11 August 1796, arriving at the Cape on 18 November. By 4 March 1797 she was at Kedgeree, and one month later at Diamond Harbour. On 9 August she reached Saugor, from which she sailed to Penang, which she reached on 24 August. On 12 October she returned to Penang, and on 11 December she was at Madras. She reached Kedgeree on 25 January 1798.
The reason for the to-and-fro was that the British government mounted an expedition against Manilla in 1797-8. (One of the Royal Navy vessels involved appears to have been HMS Sybille.) The EIC held several vessels in India to support the expedition. There were eight regular ships: Lord Camden, Busbridge, Minerva, Lord Macartney, Lord Hawkesbury, Sir Stephen Lushington, Phoenix, and General Goddard. There were also three "dismantled ships": Pitt, Lascalles, and Royal Admiral.
The captains of all the vessels sued the EIC for reimbursement for expenses consequent on the delay to their homeward bound journeys, and for the eight regular ships, the additional risks involved in the detours to Penang. In 1800 the court awarded six of the captains of the regular ships, Orrock among them, £750 each. The court further ordered that the officers of the vessels involved receive some payment. Phoenix''s officers received £250 in all. The chief mate received £64 2s 1d, the purser £25 12s 10d, and the other officers intermediate amounts.
For the return leg to Britain, Phoenix passed Saugor on 5 April. She was at the Cape on 14 September and St Helena on 3 November. She arrived at The Downs on 3 February 1799.


=== Sixth voyage (1800-02) ===
For her last voyage Phoenix was under the command of her owner, William Moffat, who sailed her for Bengal, Bombay and Mokha. Phoenix left Torbay on 27 May 1800 and reached the Cape on 6 September. On 10 November Phoenix captured the French privateer Malartic, or General Malartic, under Jean-Marie Dutertre, an action made legal by a letter of marque issued to Moffat on 6 March 1800. The capture took place at 20°15′N 91°18′E, which is about 200 km SSW of Cox's Bazaar. General Malartic was armed with 14 guns, two of them 42-pounder carronades, and had a crew of 120 men. She was five months out of Mauritius. Moffat took General Malartic with him to Bengal.
Fifteen days later Phoenix reached Kedgeree, and on 7 December she arrived at Diamond Harbour. She was at Saugor on 9 January 1801. Outward bound, she left off her pilot at the mouth of the Hooghly River on 14 January. On board she carried Major-General Sir David Baird, who was going to Trincomalee to take a faster ship to Bombay. There he would take command of the Indian army that was going to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there.
Phoenix reached Trincomalee on 25 February and Colombo on 5 March. From there she sailed to Bombay, which she reached on 2 April, arriving two days after Baird. She was apparently carrying troops for Baird's expedition to the Red Sea.
By 3 August, Phoenix was at Aden, and three weeks later at Mokha. Moffat took the opportunity to chart the mouth of the Red Sea; a copy of his chart is now in the Library of Congress.
Baird landed at Kosseir, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. He then led his troops army across the desert to Kena on the Nile, and then to Cairo. He arrived before Alexandria in time for the final operations.
Phoenix returned to Bombay by 17 October. She left Bombay on 15 November bound for Anjengo and Mahé. She was in company with several other Indiamen: Fort William, Worcester, Airly Castle, Lord Hawkesbury, and Rockingham. Phoenix she reached Tellicherry on 23 November. By 4 January 1802 Phoenix was at Anjengo. She reached St Helena by 5 April and Gravesend by 11 June.
Capturing General Malartic earned Moffat the public award of an honour sword. The privateer had captured several East Indiamen, including the Raymond, Woodcot, and Princess Royal, all of the same size as Phoenix.


== Fate ==
There is no record of her subsequent fate. In 1805 a new Phoenix made her first voyage for the HEIC.

== Voyages ==


=== Voyage #1 (1786-88) ===
Under Captain Peter Douglas, Queen sailed from The Downs on 20 Feb 1786, bound for Bombay, Bengal and China. She reached Madeira on 16 March, cleared the Cape, and on 1 July arrived at. Twenty-two days later Queen was at Bombay. From there she started around India, arriving at Tellicherry on 28 October and Kedgeree on 4 December. She then retraced her voyage, passing Saugor on 13 March 1787, stopping at Tellicherry on 25 April, and then on 8 May arriving at Bombay. From there she sailed for China, reaching Malacca on 25 August, and Whampoa anchorage on 2 October. For her journey home, she crossed the Second Bar on 31 January 1788. She reached St Helena on 12 June and anchored in The Downs on 25 August.


=== Voyage #2 (1790-92) ===
For her second voyage, Douglas was still Queen's captain. She left The Downs on 5 April 1790, bound for Madras, Bengal, and Bombay, and 15 days later arrived at Madeira. She reached Madras on 5 September, Masulipatam on 25 September, and Culpee (Calcutta) on 1 November, where her cargo of 'Small's beer and porter' and 'Bells beer and pale ale' was advertised for sale in the Calcutta Gazette. She left Diamond Harbour (also Calcutta), on 26 December, stopping at Ingeli, a point on the Hooghli River, on 15 Jan 1791. From there she sailed to 2 Feb Madras, which she reached on 2 February, and then Cannanore on 23 March and Tellicherry two days later. She arrived at Anjengo on 11 April, stopped at Cochin on 24 April, and two days later was back at Tellicherry. On 13 May she arrived at Bombay. She then sailed all the way around India to Diamond Harbour, which she arrived at 25 September. For the homeward bound trip she was at Saugor on 15 November and reached the Cape on 15 Feb 1792. Queen arrived at St Helena on 6 March and anchored in The Downs on 17 May.


=== Voyage #3 (1793-95) ===
For her third voyage, Queen was under the command of Captain Milliken Craig. As war with France had broken out, she sailed under a letter of marque that had been issued to Craig for her on 27 December 1793. Queen left Portsmouth on 2 May 1794, bound for Madras and Bengal, and reached Madras on 11 September. She sailed up India's east coast to Diamond Harbour, which she reached on 15 October. Her return voyage took her past Saugor on 30 Jan 1795 and to Madras again on 29 March. She arrived at St Helena on 17 August and the Downs of 25 November.


=== Voyage #4 (1796-98) ===
Again under Craig's command, Queen left Portsmouth on 11 August 1796, bound for St Helena and Bencoolen. She then stopped at St Helena on 16 October and the Cape on 24 November. On 17 February 1797 she arrived at Madras. She then sailed directly to Bencoolen, which she reached on 8 May. From there she sailed to Diamond Harbour, reaching it on 10 October. She passed Saugor on 16 December on her way back to Bencoolen, which she= reached on 21 February 1798. She did not arrive back in Britain until almost a year later, on 9 February 1799.


=== Voyage #5 (1800 — loss) ===
Craig and Queen left Torbay on 3 May 1800 on her last, ill-fated voyage, to Madras and China.


== Loss ==
Queen put into Salvador, Bahia, to replenish her water. She was in company with the East Indiaman Kent, with which she had left Torbay in convoy. During the night of 8–9 July a fire broke out on Queen while most of her officers and passengers were ashore. Lookouts on Kent appear to have noticed the smoke before the crew of Queen did, and Kent sent boats and fire-fighting equipment, but the currents were too strong for them to be of much use.
The fire was discovered burning in the gun-room at 3 am, though no one had visited it after 8pm. The cause of the fire was attributed to a Portuguese gunboat which had come alongside Queen, ostensibly as an anti-smuggling measure. The Portuguese gunboat had a fire lit aboard, part of which the crew threw into the Queen's gun-room scuttle, starting the fire.
The fire raged out of control, but fortunately winds and currents pushed Queen out of the bay and so away from Kent. Queen blew up at 7 am.
Casualties on board Queen were heavy. An officer on Kent wrote a letter from Salvador a little more than a week later and reported that many aboard her had drowned when they leaped into the water. He estimated that she had lost six passengers, some 30 troops (of an unspecified number that she was carrying to India) and who could not get the hatchways in time, and 70 of her crew. Because the fire broke out during the night and boats could not be launched, all the survivors, including five ladies, lost everything but whatever clothes they had on.


== Aftermath ==
Kent remained at Salvador for more than a week and then loaded the surviving troops and passengers to take them on to Calcutta. (It is not clear whether any of Queen's officers and crew also went.) Kent reportedly took on some 300 people in all. She therefore had some 440 persons on board.
On 7 October, off the Sand Heads (near the mouth of the Ganges River, Kent encountered the French privateer brig Confiance, of 18 guns and 150 men, under the command of Robert Surcouf. Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and seize control of the Kent. The British had 14 men killed, including her captain, and 44 wounded, while the French suffered five men killed and ten wounded. Surcouf released the passengers on a merchantman that he stopped a few days later.

(London: Black, Parry, and Kingsbury).Queen Charlotte was a British merchant ship launched in 1785 at Stockton for Etches & Co. Between September 1785 and 1788 she made a circumnavigation of the world in company with another ship that the company owned, the King George. The two vessels were engaged in the Maritime Fur Trade in the Pacific northwest. They sold their furs in China and returned to England with cargoes that they were carrying back for the British East India Company (EIC). The EIC then employed her for voyage as a packet, sailing to Madras and Bengal, and return.
Voyage (1785–1788)
In 1785 Richard Cadman Etches and partners, including Nathaniel Portlock and George Dixon, formed a partnership, commonly called the King George's Sound Company, to develop the fur trade. Portlock and Dixon had served in the Pacific on James Cook's third voyage. In September 1785 Portlock, in King George, and Dixon, in the smaller Queen Charlotte, sailed from England. They sailed together for most of their three-year voyage. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Falkland Islands in January 1786, and transited Cape Horn to enter the Pacific Ocean. They reached the Hawaiian islands on 24 May and anchored in Kealakekua Bay (where Cook had been killed in 1779), but did not go ashore. They took on fresh food at other Hawaiian islands and proceeded on to what is now Alaska. Dixson named the Queen Charlotte Islands after his ship. After two years of plying the waters, Portlock and Dixon departed North America, reaching Macao in November 1787.
While King George and Queen Charlotte were in China, the EIC chartered them to take cargoes back to England. Captain Dixon crossed the Second Bar on 7 February 1788, and reached North Island, the northmost of three islands in the bay that formed the principle anchorage of Enggano Island on 14 March. Queen Charlotte then reached St Helena on 18 June, and arrived at The Downs on 18 September.
Voyage (1793–1794)
Captain William Fairfax left Falmouth on 5 March 1793, bound for Madras and Bengal. Queen Charlotte reached St Helena 30 May and the Cape on 23 June, and arrived at Madras on 21 August. She arrived at Calcutta on 2 October. On 14 November she left Bankshall, a general term for the office of harbor-master or other port authority; at Calcutta the office stood on the banks of the Hooghli River. On 26 January 1794 she reached St Helena and on 30 March she arrived back at Falmouth.

New York: World Pub. House. 1876.Scourge of Malice or Malice Scourge or Mare Scourge was a 38-gun ship ordered by George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland. She was built and launched at Deptford Dockyard in 1595. The Earl used her as his flagship during raids on the Spanish Main, where she provided additional force to support his fleet. She was later renamed Red Dragon and used by the East India Company during at least five voyages to the East Indies. The first recorded performance of the play Hamlet took place on the ship in 1607, as it was anchored off the coast of Sierra Leone.


== Construction ==
In the 1590s, the Earl of Cumberland's passion for nautical adventure was at its peak. He lacked a vessel able to support his hired fleet; the only option he had to get a sufficiently armed vessel was to borrow from the Queen, something which would give her significant control over his actions. As a result, he declared that he would have his own ship built, 'the best and largest ship that had been built by any English subject.' The ship is variously recorded as being between 600 and 900 tons and was named by Queen Elizabeth I as Scourge of Malice.


== Service history ==


=== Raiding the Spanish Main (1595–1598) ===
Having had Scourge of Malice built, the Earl then departed in his new ship, along with three smaller vessels, on another expedition to raid the Spanish Main. However, the fleet had only travelled as far as Plymouth when he was recalled to London by the Queen. He returned, leaving the remainder of the small fleet to continue without him. On their return, he travelled out with them again; however on this voyage, Scourge of Malice was badly damaged in a violent storm only forty leagues from England, her mainmast being damaged, and he was once more forced to return to seek repairs.
With the repairs completed, the Earl set sail once again on 6 March 1598, Scourge of Malice now the flagship of a fleet numbering twenty vessels. After Sir Francis Drake's defeat at San Juan in 1595, the Earl of Cumberland was under orders to capture Brazil from the Spanish. Following Drake's attack, the fort at San Juan was left with 200 men and 150 volunteers, bolstered by a further 200 men when reinforcements arrived from Spain. By the time the Earl's fleet appeared off the coast of the islands on 16 June 1598, many of the Spanish soldiers had lost their discipline and turned to theft due to dysentery and the lack of food. Two initial attacks by the English were fruitless, costing them lives without any gain; the Earl of Cumberland himself almost drowning trying to cross the San Antonio channel. Knowing that the Spanish were short of supplies, the English preferred to lay siege to the castle of El Morro rather than destroy it, and on 29 June allowed the Spanish commander and troops to leave. During the attack on the town, the English had only lost 200 men, but over the next two months they lost 400 to an epidemic of dysentery, and after occupying the island for only 65 days, Cumberland abandoned the fort. Before they left, the English sacked the town, burning houses to the ground and stealing whatever caught their eye; items that included the cathedral bells and 2,000 slaves.
The fleet continued to torment the Spanish settlements in the West Indies, achieving far more for Cumberland's country than his own wealth, from sale of his captures he only made about a tenth of the money that he had invested in the voyage. The fleet lost two vessels and over a thousand men.


=== East India Company, First Voyage (1601–1603) ===

Formed on 31 December 1600, the East India Company's first voyage departed on 13 February 1601. The flagship of the five-vessel fleet was Scourge of Malice, purchased from the Earl of Cumberland for £3700. On a more peaceful mission, the East India Company renamed the vessel Red Dragon, and granted command of the vessel to James Lancaster. The other vessels in the fleet were Hector (300 tons), Ascension (260 tons), Susan (240 tons) and Gift, a small victualler. In spite of their February departure, the fleet did not clear the English Channel until early April due to delays from contrary winds. They landed at the Canary Islands, and then, keeping too close to Africa, fell into the Doldrums, where they remained for a month. They replenished their provisions from a captured Portuguese vessel on route, but much of the fleet was affected by scurvy by the time they arrived at Table Bay on 9 September. Lancaster had managed to prevent the sailors on his own ship from being so stricken by regularly dosing them with lemon juice, and he was forced to send members of his own crew to help man the other ships into the harbour. They stayed at Table Bay for seven weeks before departing, navigating along the eastern side of Madagascar. Since leaving England, they had lost more than a fifth of their crew complement across the fleet, but those that remained were fit and healthy. Adverse wind conditions, and a second bout of scurvy, forced the fleet to drop anchor in Antongil Bay, where they remained from Christmas Day through until 6 March 1602. On the resumption of their journey, they reached the Nicobar Islands after two months further travel, and took the opportunity to take on water and trim their vessels, staying for three weeks.
On 5 June, the fleet arrived in the road of Achin, on the northern end of Sumatra. There, Lancaster contacted the King, Ala-uddin Shah, who was delighted at the prospect of trade with the English, and granted them an exemption from customs dues. The goods at Achin failed to even fill one of the ships, and with Susan having already been sent to Priaman to try and procure pepper and spices, Lancaster decided to target Portuguese vessels in the Strait of Malacca to increase his cargo. The mission was successful, with Lancaster capturing a vessel en route from San Thomé (now part of Chennai) and transferring a large load of calicoes and other produce onto the English ships. The fleet then returned to Achin on 24 October 1602 and collected King Ala-uddin Shah's reply to the Queen. The three ships left Achin on 9 November, and two days later the Ascension was dispatched to return to England as it was fully laden. Red Dragon and Hector sailed to Priaman, and Lancaster delivered instructions that when Susan had finished loading her cargo of pepper and spices, she should set sail after Ascension. Lancaster pressed his remained two vessels on towards Java, arriving at Bantam on 16 December. As in Achin, they presented a letter from Queen Elizabeth I to the reigning monarch, and were granted permission to trade freely and "settle a factorie". They traded all of their remaining English goods for almost 300 bags of pepper and set up an additional factory in the Moluccas before leaving.
With a letter of reply from the King of Bantam, the two ships set sail on their return journey to England on 20 February 1603. The return journey proceeded without incident until they had rounded the Cape of Good Hope, when they were caught in a heavy and sudden storm. During the storm, Red Dragon's rudder broke off, leaving the ship at the mercy of the ocean. The ship's carpenter tried to build an improvised rudder to try to steady the ship's course, but in the rough seas it provided no relief. In spite of his crew's pleas to transfer to Hector, Lancaster insisted that the crew remain on Red Dragon, telling his crew that they would "yet abide Gods leisure." Despite the confidence he had shown his crew, he ordered Hector to leave them and return to England. When morning broke, the storm cleared as suddenly as it had appeared, and Hector was not yet over the horizon; their captain having been reluctant to leave Red Dragon while she was in distress. Another new rudder was made, this time using wood from the mizzenmast, and the best swimmers and divers from the two ships hung it securely in place. After undergoing further repairs at St Helena, Red Dragon and Hector eventually arrived back in England on 11 September 1603, three months after Ascension. Lancaster was knighted by the newly crowned King James I most likely upon his presentation of the letters from the Kings of Achin and Bantam, for his duties, but the profits from the voyage were minimal, the sheer quantity of goods making them hard to find buyers for.


=== East India Company, Second Voyage (1604–1605) ===
The Second Voyage of the East India Company to the East Indies was made by the same four ships that had made the previous voyage, with Red Dragon now under the command of Sir Henry Middleton. The fleet departed Gravesend on 25 March 1604 during the night, but when they stopped at the Downs, it was discovered that they were forty men short of their complement, and so had to wait for the remaining men. On 1 April, Red Dragon took on twenty-eight men, and despite this, Middleton was determined to set sail to make use of the beneficial wind conditions. When a new muster of the men was taken, it was found that they were now twenty-eight men over their complement; and on contacting the other vessels, they found the same trend amongst them also. Angry that he had lost use of a fair wind waiting for men he had not needed, and now would have to lose further use of it due to having to deposit those same men back to land, Middleton ordered that they should sail on to Plymouth and discharge the men there. Despite these delays, the fleet passed Cabo da Roca on 7 April, and by 15 April had reached the Canary Islands. They anchored at Maio, Cape Verde on 24 April, and set ashore in search of fresh food and water. The following day, Middleton did not go ashore, but sent the three other captains to keep their men from straggling, an order reiterated by Captain Stiles, and then by master Durham, a merchant. They were due to set sail early the next morning, but before the anchor had been raised, Captain Stiles sent word to Red Dragon that master Durham was missing. A search party numbering 150 men was sent out to search for him, but after a day's hunting failed to find the missing merchant, Middleton resolved to leave without him.

The fleet crossed the equator on 16 May, and sighted the Cape of Good Hope just under two months later, the 13 July. By this stage at least eighty of Red Dragon's crew were suffering from scurvy, and although Middleton wanted to press on with the voyage and round the Cape, his crew protested and asked to put ashore to recover. The weather played against them, and it was six days before they could get their sick on land. Having landed at Table Bay, the company traded successfully with the local inhabitants, securing over two hundred sheep, a number of beeves, kine and a bullock. On 3 August, the general (Middleton) took Red Dragon's pinnace and a company of men in other boats to hunt whales in the bay. The first harpoon to take a solid hold came from the pinnace of Susan, which was then dragged up and down the bay for half an hour until they were forced to cut the rope to ensure their own safety. The next shot that held came from the general's pinnace, and had this time struck a younger, smaller whale. As with Susan's pinnace before it, the boat was towed back and forth the bay, while the larger whale stayed with them, harrying the boats with blows. One such blow on the general's pinnace broke the timbers, causing the boat to flood and Middleton to take refuge on another of the boats. With great difficulty, the pinnace was rescued and brought ashore where it took the ship's carpenters three days to repair. Eventually the larger whale abandoned its companion, which took until sunset to die from its wounds, after which it was dragged to shore. The oil from the whale was intended for their lamps, but a combination of the small size of the whale and bad casks provided the company with less than they would have liked.
Following attacks from the native population, the fleet's company returned to their ships on 14 August, and then, with fair winds, set sail five days later. On 21 December, the fleet anchored within the islands of Sumatra, having lost a number of men to scurvy, and with a number of those that remained weakened. Due to illness, Middleton was unable to land and present the King of Bantam with a letter from King James until 31 December. It was then decided that Red Dragon and Ascension would proceed to the Maluku Islands, while Hector and Susan would return to England with their cargoes. The ships departed on 16 January, and just under a month later on 10 February made anchor off Ambon Island; having lost a number of men to flux during their journey from Java. Here they gained permission from the Portuguese commander to trade on the island. Soon after their arrival however, a Dutch fleet arrived and took the fort by force, as a result of this the natives refused to trade with the English company until permission had been granted by the Dutch. Middleton was now troubled, the Dutch were cutting off his opportunities to trade, in addition to Ambon Island, they had also beaten the English to the Banda Islands, where they were offering the same commodities as Red Dragon and Ascension had to offer. In view of this, Middleton declared that the only way they could acquire the necessary quantity of goods was for the two vessels to split up, with Red Dragon doing her best to go to the Maluku Islands, while Ascension made for the isles of Banda. The decision was not well received among the crews of the two ships, due to the weakness they were suffering from due to dysentery, and the fact that travelling to the Maluku Islands would mean sailing against both wind and current. Despite these issues, the plan was carried out, Red Dragon sailing for a month before sighting the Maluku Islands.

The company purchased fresh supplies from the people of Maquian, but the natives refused to trade or sell any cloves without permission from the King of Ternate. Duly, Red Dragon sailed on towards Tidore and Ternate, more eastward islands. On 22 March, they became involved in a small fracas between Tidore and Ternate. Two Ternate galleys were rowing at best possible speed, hailing the Red Dragon to wait for them, being chased by seven Tidore galleys. Middleton ordered the ship to slow and find out what was going on; they found that the galley contained the King of Ternate and three Dutch merchants. The Dutch pleaded with Middleton to rescue the second vessel, which contained more of their kinsmen who would be killed by the chasing Tidore. Red Dragon fired at the Tidore galleys, but they maintained their course, and once within range, fired their own weapons at the trailing Ternate galley. They then boarded the vessel, killing all but three of the crew, those three having abandoned the vessel and swam to Red Dragon. In the aftermath of the attack, the Ternate King endeavoured to talk Middleton out of trading with their enemies on Tidore, and promoted the idea of setting up a factory on Ternate instead. Middleton was set on travelling to Tidore to trade with the Portuguese, saying that if they would not accept peaceable trade, he would have just cause to join the Dutch in war against them. They arrived at Tidore on 27 March, and the following day met Thomè de Torres, captain of one of the Portuguese galleon. Red Dragon traded successfully and remained at Tidore for the next three weeks, acquiring all but 80 bahars of the cloves on the island. The remaining cloves were unavailable as they belonged to merchants of Malacca.
Accordingly, on 19 April, Red Dragon prepared to depart for Maquian; an island mostly sworn to the King of Ternate, with the exception of the town of Taffasoa, which was sworn to the King of Tidore. Already in possession of a letter from the Ternate king, the Tidore king also wrote a letter asking the town's governor to trade with the English. With a Dutch fleet closing in on the island of Tidore, intending to take the island from the Portuguese, Red Dragon departed two days later, needing to sound her trumpets as she passed the Dutch fleet at around midnight to identify herself, in case the Dutch thought she was an escaping Portuguese galleon. Safely past the Dutch, the ship and her crew arrived at Maquian at seven the following evening. On their arrival, Middleton sent his brother along with two Ternatans that had remained with the ship to present the governor with the king's letters. After a public reading of the letter, the governor announced that the cloves on the island were not ripe yet, but that those that were the English could have the next day. When the next day came however, they were told that there were no ripe cloves on the island, and Middleton, suspecting Ternatan duplicity, decided to sail for Taffasoa. They were more forthcoming, and the English managed to acquire an amount of cloves for them before the Ternate attacked the town. With the town's governor informing them that there were no more cloves to be had, and receiving word from the fort on Tidore that the Dutch had burnt two galleons, Red Dragon returned to Tidore on 3 May.
In addition to the Dutch fleet, the King of Ternate and all his caracoas were there, as part of the attack on their enemies. Red Dragon received a cold reception from the Dutch, who claimed that a Guzerat had told them that they had assisted the Portuguese during the last battle, a claim the English vehemently denied. The Dutch then described the battle ensuing, and their plans to attack the fort on the next day. That evening Captain de Torres came aboard and told Middleton that they (the Portuguese) were sure of victory against the Dutch, and would trade any remaining cloves with the English. At around one in the afternoon on 7 May, the Dutch and Ternate attacked, firing all their ordnance at the fort. During particularly heavy fire, the attacking forces landed men on the island, a little north of the town, who entrenched themselves there for the night. The attack continued the next morning, and the landed men were now within a mile of the fort and set up a large piece of ordnance to further bombard the fort. The morning of 9 May, the attack began before sunrise, and catching the Portuguese unaware, the Dutch and Ternate scaled the walls and raised their colours in the fort. During the ensuing battle, the Portuguese and Tidorean forces got the upper hand and drove their enemies from the fort, forcing them to drop their weapons and retreat into the sea. Just as the battle seemed won, the fort exploded, and the combined Dutch and Ternatan forces rallied. The Portuguese retreated once more, sacking the town as they did so, burning the factory with the cloves and leaving nothing of worth.


=== East India Company, Third Voyage (1607–10) ===
On 12 March 1607, Red Dragon, along with Consent and Hector were ordered to travel to Java to maintain trading relationships, and to establish new relationships with India and Aden. William Keeling had command of the fleet, and took Red Dragon as his flagship. Shortly after leaving Tilbury, the ships were separated by storms. Consent then made a rapid trip to the Maluku Islands, while the other two ships had a much slower journey. According to surviving transcripts of Keeling, they performed Hamlet twice and Richard II once during their outward journey. They failed to reach Aden, and according to Keeling's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry, "the crew of the Dragon frustrated Keeling's plan to sail to the [Maluku Islands]." Journals from the voyage exist, that of John Hearne and William Finch is held in the British Library, while that of Keeling has been lost, but extracts have been variously published.


=== East India Company, Tenth Voyage (1612–14) ===
Under the command of Thomas Best, Red Dragon took part in the tenth voyage of the East India Company, securing trading rights for the company at Surat in September 1612, and two months later engaging a Portuguese fleet and driving them from the Gulf of Cambay. Hosiander (or Osiander) assisted Red Dragon in defeating the fleet, which consisted of some 30 vessels.
By January of the following year, Best had set up a factory at Surat and extended trade to Ahmedabad, Burhanpur and Agra.


=== East India Company, Voyage (1615–17) ===
Red Dragon was again commanded by William Keeling during a voyage that also included Lyon, Peppercorn, and Expedition which sailed from Tilbury in February 1615. Keeling had been asked by the East India Company to restructure their Asian trading links. His wife was pregnant at the time, and Keeling tried to smuggle her aboard the Red Dragon, but was not allowed. He put her ashore after being threatened with dismissal, and the fleet left on 23 February. During the voyage, Keeling set up a factory in Sumatra, and was considered to have worked hard. However, he convinced his bosses to allow him to return home to his wife after he suffered ill health, returning in May 1617.


=== Sinking (1619) ===
In October 1619, Red Dragon, commanded by Robert Bonner, was attacked by a Dutch fleet at Secoo and was taken, or sunk. Captain Bonner was mortally wounded and died on 9 October.


== Ambiguity ==
Records of the voyages of the East India Company, including those made at the time, often refer to Red Dragon simply as Dragon, familiarity resulting in the shortened title. This however can make tracing the history of the vessel more difficult. Although Sainsbury and Boulger both record the sinking of the vessel in 1619, a later reference is made to a ship named Dragon, commanded by John Weddell in 1637–38. In Jean Sutton's Lords of the East; The East India Company and Its Ships, no fewer than four ships named Dragon are listed, and none named Red Dragon. The first of these, listed as Dragon, 600 tons, 6 voyages, period of service: 1601–18 is almost undoubtedly the Red Dragon. The next East India Company ship chronologically is not until 1658, a vessel which undertook only one voyage,. Which leaves the ship commanded by John Weddell in 1637-1638 unaccounted for.

Purchas, Samuel (1905). Hakluytus posthumus 2. Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons. pp. 502–549.Royal Charlotte was launched in 1789 as an East Indiaman for the British East India Company (EIC). She made two trips to China for the EIC and on the second of these, after the outbreak of war with France in 1793, assisted at the British capture of Pondicherry. Then, the Admiralty, desirous of quickly building up the Royal Navy, purchased a number of commercial vessels, including nine East Indiamen, to meet the need for small two-decker fourth rates to serve as convoy escorts. The Admiralty purchased Royal Charlotte in 1795 and renamed her HMS Malabar. She made a trip to the West Indies where she was the lead ship of a small squadron that captured some Dutch colonies. She foundered in 1796 while escorting a convoy in the North Atlantic.


== East Indiaman ==
Royal Charlotte was the first vessel built at Northfleet. Josiah Pryce, who was her captain for both her journeys to the Far East, seems to have been a thoroughly unpleasant and cruel person.
Journey #1 (1790-91)
Pryce left The Downs on 5 January 1790, bound for St Helena, Benkulen and China. Royal Charlotte arrived at St Helena on 27 March. She reached Benkulen on 21 June, and Whampoa anchorage on 24 August. On her return leg, she crossed the Second Bar on 15 November, arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 9 April 1791, St Helena on 28 April, and returned to the Downs on 26 June.
Journey #2 (1792-94)
Royal Charlotte left The Downs on 27 December 1792, bound for St Helena, Madras and China. She arrived at St Helena on 13 March 1793 and Madras on 10 June. From there she went to Pondicherry, arriving 14 July. There Triton, Warley, and Royal Charlotte participated in the capture of Pondicherry by maintaining a blockade of the port, together with HMS Minerva. During the blockade the British also captured a vessel "from the islands" that was bringing in military supplies. Pondicherry surrendered on 23 August and Royal Charlotte returned to Madras, arriving on 27 August. On 1 October she arrived at Penang, where the EIC had recently built a factory. Nineteen days later she was at Malacca.
Having left Malacca, the same three East Indiamen from Pondicherry participated in an action in the Straits of Malacca. They came upon a French frigate, with some six or seven of her prizes, replenishing her water casks ashore. The three British vessels immediately gave chase. The frigate fled towards the Sunda Strait, abandoning her prizes. The Indiamen were able to catch up with a number of the prizes, and after a few cannon shots, were able to retake them. The British then returned the prizes to their crews, and took the French prize crews aboard as prisoners of war.
Royal Charlotte arrived at Whampoa on 14 December. At Whampoa that December were several other East Indiamen, among which were several that on their return to Britain the Admiralty would purchase: Warley, Ceres, Earl of Abergavenny, and Hindostan. The British Government had chartered Hindostan to take Lord Macartney to China in an unsuccessful attempt to open diplomatic and commercial relations with the Chinese empire.
Royal Charlotte crossed the Second Bar on 16 February 1794 and reached St Helena on 19 June. She arrived at The Downs on 8 September.


== Royal Navy service & loss ==
Royal Charlotte was commissioned in April 1795 under Captain Thomas Parr and renamed HMS Malabar the next month, as the royal yacht HMY Royal Charlotte was still in service. Thomas Pitcher, who had built the now Malabar, refitted her for naval service, completing the work on 17 July.
Malabar sailed for the West Indies on 24 February 1796. On 15 April, Captain Parr was the naval commander of a small task force that included Malabar, the frigate HMS Undaunted, HMS Babet, HMS Pique, and some transports, and 1200 troops from the 39th, 93rd and 99th Regiments of Foot under Major-General John Whyte to capture the Dutch settlements of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice. The 64-gun third rate HMS Scipio, under the command of Captain Francis Laforey, joined the squadron at Demerara. Demerara and Esseqquibo surrendered on the 22nd, and Berbice followed on the 2nd of May. At Demerara the British also captured the Dutch 24-gun ship Thetis, the 12-gun cutter Seagull, and several merchant vessels. The Royal Navy took Thetis and the cutter into service.
Malabar left Jamaica in July as escort for a convoy sailing for Britain. Some 800 miles west of Land's End she separated from the convoy in bad weather. By 5 October the weather was a full Atlantic storm. Malabar did not handle the storm well, losing all three masts, and having her tiller broken and rudder unshipped. Four carronades came loose and killed one man, injured four others, and damaged her boats before they could be tumbled into the hold. The crew threw her guns overboard and, once the winds had dropped, jury-rigged her, but her timbers started to give way and let in water. On 8 October the merchant brig Martha, of Whitby, came up. She took on Malabar's crew, who abandoned the ship on 11 October.
The subsequent court martial dismissed the service of a Lieutenant Crocombe for having spent much of the time of the crisis in the wardroom drunk. It also reprimanded the master for joining Crocombe in his drinking and for getting disablingly drunk.

ISBN 1861762461.George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ("Hanover") in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two predecessors he was born in Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover.
His life and reign, which were longer than any other British monarch before him, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American Revolutionary War. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.
In the later part of his life, George III had recurrent, and eventually permanent, mental illness. Although it has since been suggested that he had the blood disease porphyria, the cause of his illness remains unknown. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George III's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.
Historical analysis of George III's life has gone through a "kaleidoscope of changing views" that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them. Until re-assessment occurred during the second half of the twentieth century, his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant and in Britain he became "the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism".


== Early life ==

George was born in London at Norfolk House. He was the grandson of King George II, and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. As Prince George was born two months premature and was thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's and the Bishop of Oxford.

One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were the King of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle the Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy) and his great-aunt the Queen of Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy).
George grew into a healthy but reserved and shy child. The family moved to Leicester Square, where George and his younger brother Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing, and riding. His religious education was wholly Anglican. At age 10 George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play Cato and said in the new prologue: "What, tho' a boy! It may with truth be said, A boy in England born, in England bred". Historian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear "to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated".
George's grandfather, King George II, disliked the Prince of Wales and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).
In the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at St James's Palace, but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, Lord Bute, who would later serve as Prime Minister. George's mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.


== Marriage ==
In 1759, George was smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of the Duke of Richmond, but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. "I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation," he wrote, "and consequently must often act contrary to my passions." Nevertheless, attempts by the King to marry George to Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel were resisted by him and his mother; Sophie married the Margrave of Bayreuth instead.
The following year, at the age of 22, George succeeded to the throne when his grandfather, George II, died suddenly on 25 October 1760, two weeks before his 77th birthday. The search for a suitable wife intensified. On 8 September 1761 in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, the King married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whom he met on their wedding day. A fortnight later, both were crowned at Westminster Abbey. George remarkably never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a genuinely happy marriage. They had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace) for use as a family retreat. His other residences were Kew and Windsor Castle. St James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively, and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at Weymouth, Dorset, which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.


== Early reign ==

George, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain". He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, in order to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.
Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. George was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat. On his accession, the Crown lands produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the Crown Estate to Parliamentary control in return for a civil list annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government. Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts are disputed by historians who say such claims "rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition". Debts amounting to over £3 million over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time. He aided the Royal Academy of Arts with large grants from his private funds, and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity. Of his art collection, the two most notable purchases are Johannes Vermeer's Lady at the Virginals and a set of Canalettos, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered. The King's Library was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.

In May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of the Duke of Newcastle was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory Lord Bute. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish prejudices amongst the English. John Wilkes, a Member of Parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons, and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power.
Later that year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 placed a limit upon the westward expansion of the American colonies. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida). The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions. The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to "no taxation without representation". In 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. Meanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.
Lord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt and the King, repealed Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and the Duke of Grafton took over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. Wilkes was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor. Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.

George was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was not shared by his brothers. George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer, and the following year Cumberland married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession. George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.
Lord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was "one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]". In 1773, the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. In Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was "certainly criminal". With the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. Up to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's "hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution." Though the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers.


== American War of Independence ==

The American Revolutionary War was the culmination of the civil and political American Revolution resulting from the American Enlightenment. Brought to a head over the lack of American representation in Parliament, which was seen as a denial of their rights as Englishmen and often popularly focused on direct taxes levied by Parliament on the colonies without their consent, the colonists resisted the imposition of direct rule after the Boston Tea Party. Creating self-governing provinces, they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774. Armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. After petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament were ignored, the rebel leaders were declared traitors by the Crown and a year of fighting ensued. The colonies declared their independence in July 1776, listing grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George's other offences, the Declaration charged, "He has abdicated Government here ... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people." The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down. The British captured the city in 1776, but lost Boston, and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga.
George III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. In the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan, the King was determined "never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal." The King wanted to "keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse". However, more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe. After Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority. With the setbacks in America, Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to cooperate. He died later in the same year. In early 1778, France (Britain's chief rival) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States and the conflict escalated. The United States and France were soon joined by Spain and the Dutch Republic, while Britain had no major allies of its own. Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government. Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III's insistence. Opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the Gordon Riots.
As late as the Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised the independence of the American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, "I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power."


== Constitutional struggle ==
With the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the Duke of Portland. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox–North Coalition. The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister, with Fox and Lord North, as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively.
The King disliked Fox intensely, for his politics as well as his character; he thought Fox was unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales. George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be displaced easily. He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the East India Company to Parliamentary commissioners. Although the King actually favoured greater control over the Company, the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox. Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George authorised Lord Temple to inform the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and William Pitt the Younger was appointed Prime Minister, with Temple as his Secretary of State. On 17 December 1783, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a "high crime" and Temple was forced to resign. Temple's departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent election gave Pitt a firm mandate.


== William Pitt ==

For George III, Pitt's appointment was a great victory. It proved that he was able to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.
By this time George's health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness, which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. A study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. The source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. The King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate. It was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100 miles (150 km)—but his condition worsened. In November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse. With his doctors largely at a loss to explain his illness, spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out "evil humours".
In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, the Prince of Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.


== French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ==

After George’s recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales. His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity. James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot the King in the Drury Lane Theatre on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval.
The French Revolution of 1789, in which the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France declared war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of habeas corpus. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.
A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. In 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". George used the opportunity to drop the title "king of France", which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. It was suggested that George adopt the title "Emperor of the British Isles", but he refused. As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. At about the same time, the King had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.
George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an "experiment". In 1803, the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in Hyde Park, London, on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day. The Times said, "The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression." A courtier wrote on 13 November that, "The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning". George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd, "We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion ... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them." After Admiral Lord Nelson's famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, the possibility of invasion was extinguished.

In 1804, George's recurrent illness returned; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George III refused. Lord Grenville perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry. Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This Third Coalition, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his "Ministry of All the Talents" included Fox. The King was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future. They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland as the nominal Prime Minister, with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spencer Perceval. Parliament was dissolved, and the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance.


== Later life ==

In late 1810, at the height of his popularity but already virtually blind with cataracts and in pain from rheumatism, George III became dangerously ill. In his view the malady had been triggered by stress over the death of his youngest and favourite daughter, Princess Amelia. The Princess's nurse reported that "the scenes of distress and crying every day ... were melancholy beyond description." He accepted the need for the Regency Act of 1811, and the Prince of Wales acted as Regent for the remainder of George III's life. Despite signs of a recovery in May 1811, by the end of the year George had become permanently insane and lived in seclusion at Windsor Castle until his death.
Prime Minister Spencer Perceval was assassinated in 1812 and was replaced by Lord Liverpool. Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. The subsequent Congress of Vienna led to significant territorial gains for Hanover, which was upgraded from an electorate to a kingdom.
Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf. He was incapable of knowing or understanding either that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38 pm on 29 January 1820, six days after the death of his fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him. George III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.
George was succeeded by two of his sons George IV and William IV, who both died without surviving legitimate children, leaving the throne to the only legitimate child of the Duke of Kent, Victoria, the last monarch of the House of Hanover.


== Legacy ==

George III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors. Only Victoria and Elizabeth II have since lived and reigned longer.
George III was dubbed "Farmer George" by satirists, at first to mock his interest in mundane matters rather than politics, but later to contrast his homely thrift with his son's grandiosity and to portray him as a man of the people. Under George III, the British Agricultural Revolution reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry. There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent Industrial Revolution. George's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now housed in the Science Museum, London; he funded the construction and maintenance of William Herschel's 40-foot telescope, which was the biggest ever built at the time. Herschel discovered the planet Uranus, which he at first named Georgium Sidus (George's Star) after the King, in 1781.
George III hoped that "the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve", but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. While very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists, though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal. The grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as "repeated injuries and usurpations" that he had committed to establish an "absolute Tyranny" over the colonies. The Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. Contemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating "attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power", while the other "derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition".
Building on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was "much maligned", kick-started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign. Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: "Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence ... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors ... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth." In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality.


== Titles, styles and arms ==


=== Titles and styles ===
4 June 1738 – 31 March 1751: His Royal Highness Prince George
31 March 1751 – 20 April 1751: His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh
20 April 1751 – 25 October 1760: His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales
25 October 1760 – 29 January 1820: His Majesty The King
In Great Britain, George III used the official style "George the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and so forth". In 1801, when Great Britain united with Ireland, he dropped the title of king of France, which had been used for every English monarch since Edward III's claim to the French throne in the medieval period. His style became "George the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith."
In Germany, he was "Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg, Archtreasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire" until the end of the empire in 1806. He then continued as duke until the Congress of Vienna declared him "King of Hanover" in 1814.


=== Arms ===
Before his succession, George was granted the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, and along with the dukedom of Edinburgh and the position of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points Argent. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted on the arms of the heir, only on the Sovereign's.
From his succession until 1800, George bore the royal arms: Quarterly, I Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); IV tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Saxony), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).
Following the Acts of Union 1800, the royal arms were amended, dropping the French quartering. They became: Quarterly, I and IV England; II Scotland; III Ireland; overall an escutcheon of Hanover surmounted by an electoral bonnet. In 1816, after the Electorate of Hanover became a kingdom, the electoral bonnet was changed to a crown.

OCLC 67375475.Swallow was a teak-built packet ship that the British East India Company (EIC) launched at Bombay in 1779. She made nine trips between India and Britain for the EIC between 1782 and 1803. Her most notable exploit occurred on her seventh voyage, when she helped capture seven Dutch East Indiamen on 15 June 1795. The Royal Navy purchased her in 1804 and named her Lilly. She served in the Navy until she was sold in 1811. During this time she participated in the capture of La Désirade, and participated in a quixotic and unsuccessful attempt of General Francisco de Miranda to liberate the Province of Venezuela from Spain in 1806. Her whereabouts between 1811 and 1815 are obscure, but in 1815 J. Lyney, of London, purchased her and she sailed to the West Indies and to India as an EIC-licensed vessel until she wrecked on her way to Calcutta in 1823.


== East India Company packet ==
Un-numbered voyage (1779–81)
There seems to be no record of what Swallow did immediately after her launching in 1779, or how she arrived at England, but on 24 January 1781, Swallow, under the command of Captain Sober Hall, sailed from Limerick for Madras, with the Right Hon. Lord Macartney, the new governor of Madras, Mr. Staunton and Mr. Lacelles, his Lordship's secretaries, Col. Cowper, Mr. Kerin of the county Clare, and Mr. Exshaw of Dublin, with several other passengers. Lord Macartney arrived at Madras on 22 June 1781.
Voyage #1 (1782–85)
The first voyage to the UK for which National Archive records exist was in 1782. In that year Captain Sober Hall sailed from India, reaching Limerick, which she left on 4 October 1782, and arriving at The Downs on 10 April 1783. Swallow left the Downs on 16 September 1783 under the command of Captain Richard Bendy. Bendy was carrying to India the preliminary articles of a treaty between George III and the States General of the United Provinces, and the definitive peace treaty between the crowns of Great Britain, France, and Spain (Treaties of Versailles).
Voyage #2 (1785–86)
Swallow left Bengal on 16 August 1785 under the command of Capt Richard Bendy, though Captain Robert Anderson may have replaced him at some point on the voyage. She reached the Cape on 17 October, and St Helena on 11 November. She arrived at the Downs on 8 January 1786.
Voyage #3 (1786–87)
Captain Robert Anderson left Portsmouth on 7 May 1786, bound for Madras and Bengal. Swallow reached Johanna on 29 July, and Madras on 21 August, arriving at Calcutta on 12 September. Outward bound, she passed Kedgeree on 19 November and again reached Madras on 1 December. She then stopped at St Helena on 31 January 1787 before reaching the Downs on 30 March.
Voyage #4 (1788-1790)
Captain Robert Anderson and Swallow left the Downs on 26 June 1788 and Falmouth on 26 August, reaching the Cape on 5 November and arriving at Calcutta on 25 January 1789. Outward bound, she passed kedgeree on 22 February, reached Madras on 9 March, Negapatam on 29 April, Madras again on 4 May, and Calcutta again on 12 June. She left Diamond Harbour on 19 August, reached St Helena on 28 October, and arrived at the Downs on 10 January 1790. She was at her moorings on 17 January.
Voyage #5 (1790–92)
Captain George Curtis left Portsmouth on 12 June 1790, reached the Cape on 24 August, Madras on 5 October, and Calcutta on 7 November. On 8 December Swallow passed Culpee (an anchorage near Calcutta), reached Madras on 14 December, Negaptam on 21 December, Madras again on 5 January 1791, Cuddalore on 2 February, Madras yet again on 4 February, Port Cornwallis on 25 February, Penang on 8 March, Madras on 26 March, Nagore on 27 April, Madras on 2 May, Masulipatam on 10 July, Madras on 17 July, Negapatam on 19 August, and Madras for the last time on this voyage on 25 August. Swallow reached St Helena on 29 November and arrived at Bristol on 25 January 1792.
Voyage #6 (1792–94)
Captain George Curtis left the Downs on 18 October 1792 for Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. She arrived at Calcutta on 10 March, Madras on 27 April, Madras, and Bombay on 16 June. She left Bombay on 7 August and reached Anjengo on 15 August, and Madras 24 August. She left Madras on 10 October, reached st Helena on 15 December, and arrived at Torbay on 4 February 1794, and the Downs on 16 February.
Voyage #7 and the capture of the Dutch Indiamen (1795–97)
Captain William Clifton left Falmouth on 2 January 1795. On 2 June Swallow arrived at St Helena from the Cape of Good Hope with the news than a convoy of Dutch East Indiamen had left the Cape, sailing for the Netherlands.

The eight unescorted Dutch East Indiaman that had sailed on 22 May had the misfortune to encounter HMS Sceptre, the East Indiaman General Goddard, and Swallow near Saint Helena. On 3 June, Sceptre, General Goddard, Manship (also an EIC ship), and Swallow set out. Five other HEIC ships set out later, of which only Busbridge met up with the squadron. On 7 June, the squadron captured the "richly laden" Julie. Three days later, the British captured the Dutch Indiaman Hougly, which Swallow escorted into St Helena, before returning to the squadron with additional seamen.
In the afternoon of 14 June, the British squadron sighted seven sail. At 1 a.m. the next morning General Goddard sailed through the Dutch fleet, which fired on her. She did not fire back. Later that morning, after some exchange of shots between the British and Dutch vessels, the Dutch surrendered. The EIC ships Busbridge, Captain Samuel Maitland, and Asia, Captain John Davy Foulkes, arrived on the scene and helped board the Dutch vessels. There were no casualties on either side. The British then brought their prizes into St Helena on 17 June.
On 1 July, Sceptre, General Goddard and the prizes sailed from St Helena to gather in other returning British East Indiamen. They then returned to St Helena, where George Vancouver and Discovery, which had arrived there in the meantime, joined them. The entire convoy, now some 20 vessels or so strong, sailed from there on 22 August for Shannon.
Because the captures occurred before Britain had declared war on the Batavian Republic, the vessels became Droits to the Crown. Still, prize money, in the amount of two-thirds of the value of the Dutch ships amounted to £76,664 14s. Of this, £61,331 15s 2d was distributed among the officers and crew of Sceptre, General Goddard, Busbridge, Asia, and Swallow. The remainder went to the garrison at St Helena, and various vessels in the St Helena roads. Thirty-three years later, in July 1828, there was a small final payment.
Swallow sailed from Bengal in September 1796, reaching Rangoon on 10 October and leaving on 12 November, reaching Penang on 24 November, Madras on 19 December, Trincomalee on 22 December, Madras on 4 January 1797, and St Helena on 15 March, arriving on 2 May at Torbay.
Voyage #8 (1799-1803)
Captain John Luard left Falmouth on 6 September 1799 bound for China, and then Mokha and Madras. Luard sailed with a letter of marque issued 25 July 1799.
Luard and Swallow apparently sighted Yap around February 1800. (At some point Arthur Muter replaced Luard as Captain.) She left Calcutta on 19 November 1801, reached Mokha on 13 January 1802, and Madras on 28 March. She left Madras on 13 October, reaching Calcutta on 7 November. She passed Saugor on 1 March 1803, reached St Helena on 12 May, and Falmouth on 14 July. She arrived at the Downs on 29 July.


== HMS Lilly ==
The Admiralty purchased Swallow in May 1804 and named her Lilly (or equally Lily), presumably while she was fitting out, which was after the loss of a Lilly in July. Retaining her name was apparently not an option as a Swallow had just been laid down.
Lilly underwent fitting out, including receiving a heavier armament than the EIC provided, between 21 August and 11 December. Commander John Morrison commissioned her in October, for the Leeward Islands.
In March 1806 Lieutenant Donald Campbell replaced Morrison. During this period, two privateers captured a tender that was serving Lilly and the crew aboard her were prisoners at Cumaná (now part of Venezuela), for several months. After they returned to Lilly she encountered the ship Leander, of 22 guns and 200 men. This vessel was carrying General Francisco de Miranda and his revolutionaries after a botched landing attempt in Ocumare de la Costa whose objective was to free the province of Venezuela from Spain rule. The botched landing only resulted in two Spanish garda costas, Argos and Celoso, capturing two of Miranda's vessels, Bacchus and Bee. The Spanish government put 60 of the men hey had captured on trial in Puerto Cabello, and sentenced ten to death. Lilly escorted Leander and Miranda to Grenada and then to Barbados, where Miranda met with Admiral Alexander Cochrane. As Spain was then at war with Britain, the British agree to provide some support for a second attempt.
Lilly left Trinidad on 24 July, together with Express, Attentive, Prevost, and Leander, carrying General Miranda and some 220 officers and men. General Miranda decided to land in La Vela de Coro and the squadron anchored there on 1 August. The next day the frigate Bacchante joined them; she stayed some three days. On 3 August 60 Trinidadian volunteers, under the Count de Rouveray, 60 men under Col. Dowie, and 30 seamen and marines from Lily, under Lieutenant Beddingfelt landed. This force cleared the beach of Spanish forces and captured a batter of four 9 and 12-pounder guns; the attackers had four men severely wounded, all from Lilly. Shortly thereafter boats from Bacchante landed American volunteers and seamen and marines. The Spanish retreated, which enabled this force to capture two forts mounting 14 guns. General Miranda then marched on Coro, which he captured. However, on 8 August a Spanish force of almost 2000 men arrived. They captured a master of transport and 14 seamen who were getting water, unbeknownst to Campbell. Lily landed 20 men on the morning of 10 August; this landing party killed a dozen Spaniards, but was able to rescue only one of the captive seamen. Col. Downie and 50 men were sent, but the colonel judged the enemy force too strong and withdrew. When another 400 men came from Maracaibo, General Miranda realized that his force was too small to achieve anything further. Lilly and her squadron then carried him and his men safely to Aruba.
Although Campbell was next in line for a promotion, the letter notifying the Admiralty of his acting command of Lilly did not arrive in time. Instead, Commander William Henry Shirreff was appointed to Lilly on 3 March 1806, but did not take command until towards the end of the year. Campbell took command of Pert, and his promotion to Commander was confirmed on 4 May 1807.
Lilly was part of the squadron under Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane that captured the Danish islands of St Thomas on 22 December and Santa Cruz on 25 December 1807. The Danes did not resist and the invasion was bloodless.
On 29 March 1808, Cerberus, in company with Lilly, Pelican, Express, Swinger and Mosambique, sailed from Marie-Galante to attack the island of La Désirade. They arrived on 30 March and landed seamen and marines under the command of Captain Sherriff. As the squadron approached they exchanged fire with a battery of 9-pounders covering the entrance to the harbour. The ships' guns silenced the battery and the French surrendered.
The inhabitants of La Désirade took an oath of neutrality, so Admiral Alexander Cochrane did not place a garrison on the island, though the British did destroy the island's shore batteries. Cochrane also left Lilly, Express, and Mosambique there both to deny the island to French privateers and to forestall any French attempt to recapture it.
On 21 April Mosambique chased and captured the French letter of marque brig Jean Jacques. She and her prize, the British brig Brothers of Liverpool, were seeking to take shelter at La Désirade, not knowing that the island was in British hands. Jean Jacques was pierced for 18 guns but carried only six long 9-pounders. She was 36 days out of Bordeaux and sailing for Guadeloupe. Sherriff, the commander of the squadron to which Mosambique belonged, reported that he was particularly pleased at the capture as Jean Jacques had been sent out for "the express Purpose of cruising in these Seas, and, from her superior Sailing, would have proved a great Annoyance to the Trade." While Mosambique was capturing the Jean Jacques, the squadron saw a brig on fire. The squadron's boats went to the brig's assistance, extinguished the flames, and discovered that it was Brothers. In the entire affair, the British had no casualties and the French suffered only one man wounded.
Sherriff received promotion to post captain on 15 November 1809.


== Return to civilian service ==
The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the "Lily Sloop, 352 Tons", lying at Portsmouth, for sale on 17 November 1811. She sold that month.
Lilly's whereabouts between 1811 and 1815 are currently obscure.
In 1814 or '15, J. Lyney, London, purchased Lilly and returned her to her original name of Swallow. She then traded to South America and India as an EIC licensed ship.
Lloyd's Register
Lloyd's Register for 1819 has a second entry for Swallow. It shows her as being of 361 tons (bm), with master W. Oliver, and owner J. Lyney, sailing on 15 February 1818 to Bombay for the EIC.


== Fate ==
Swallow wrecked on 16 June 1823 on the James and Mary Shoal, River Hooghly, while sailing from London for Calcutta. She was totally lost, and three of crew died; the remainder, and her passengers, apparently were able to get ashore, though they lost all their possessions. Swallow was the EIC's most successful fast-sailing packet.

She made three full voyages for the EIC before the French privateer Robert Surcouf captured her in 1796 while she was on her fourth voyage. The British Royal Navy recaptured her in 1798 and the EIC chartered her for three more voyages to Britain. Her subsequent fate is unknown.


== First voyage (1788-89) ==
Under the command of Captain William Agnew, Triton sailed from The Downs on 5 April 1788, bound for Madras and Bengal. She reached Madras on 14 July and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 23 July. She left Bengal on 30 December, reached St Helena on 7 March, before arriving at The Downs on 14 May.


== Second voyage (1790-91) ==
Captain Agnew again left The Downs on 5 January 1790, this time bound for Madras and China. Triton reached Madras on 9 July, and arrived at Whampoa on 30 August. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 2 February 1791, reached the Cape on 9 April and St Helena on 28 April, arriving at The Downs on 28 June.


== Third voyage (1793-94) ==
Capt Philip Burnyeat sailed Triton from Torbay on 13 January 1793, bound for Madras, Bengal and China. She reached Madras on 21 May, leaving on 6 July. Trtion was at Pondicherry on 15 July, together with Warley, and Royal Charlotte, maintaining a blockade of the port, together with HMS Minerva. Triton had sailed from Fort Saint George (Madras) as escort to Admiral Lord Cornwallis, then Governor General of India, who was traveling to Pondicherry in a small captured French vessel. Triton also escorted him back, returning to Madras on 30 July. (Pondicherry fell to the Army on 23 August.) She reached Kedgeree on 8 August, and then on 8 September was at Madras again. She reached Penang on 4 October and Malacca on 19 October, before arriving at Whampoa on 15 December. She crossed the Second Bar on 14 March 1794, reached St Helena on 18 June, left on 1 July, and arrived at The Downs on 17 September.


== Fourth voyage and capture (1795-96) ==

Captain Burnyeat left Portsmouth on 9 July 1795, bound for Madras and Bengal. Because she was travelling in wartime, Burnyeat had arranged for a letter of marque, as was customary for EIC ships, which was issued to him on 1 May 1795. This authorized him to engage in offensive action against the French, not just defensive. The French captured Triton at Balasore Roads on 29 January 1796.
The privateer Robert Surcouf had had a successful cruise in the Indian Ocean capturing several vessels, including the pilot boat Cartier, which he renamed Hasard. He transferred his remaining men from his ship Émilie to Hasard and on 28 January, sighting Triton at anchor, decided to attack. He recognised only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent. Surcouf, feeling unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men, After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before hoisting French colours at the very last moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including Burnyeat and the first officer, Picket; Surcouf transferred his prisoners to Diana, another vessel that he had captured, and which he released to her captain against a 30,000 rupee ransom.
Surcouf returned to Île de France (Mauritius) with his prizes, arriving on 10 March 1796. However, Émilie had been sailing without a letter of marque, so although the Prize court declared the prizes legal, it seized them and sold them for the benefit of the State.


== Recapture and subsequent career ==
The Royal Navy recaptured Triton and she arrived at Madras on 24 June 1798. Thereafter she served as a country ship, i.e., sailing in the coastal trade.
However, the EIC chartered her as an extra ship for three voyages, for which records exist for the second and third:
First voyage (1798–99)
Triton, under the command of Captain David Dunlop, arrived in England on 28 September 1799 from Madras.
Second voyage (1800-1801)
Captain David Dunlop left Madras on 10 October 1800, bound for London. Triton reached St Helena on 12 December, and Spithead on 22 February 1801. She was at The Downs on 1 March, and London on 5 March. There she delivered a cargo of rice.
Third voyage (1802)
Captain Nicholas Anstis left Calcutta on 26 February 1802. Triton left Kedgeree on 17 April, and reached St Helena on 9 July. she arrived at The Downs on 13 September.


== Fate ==
Triton's ultimate fate is currently unknown.

She was under the command of John Brooke when she was wrecked on the Tryal Rocks off the north-west coast of Western Australia in 1622. Her crew were the first Englishmen to sight or land on Australia. The wreck is Australia's oldest known shipwreck.


== Her final voyage ==
The ship departed Plymouth on her maiden voyage for Bantam on 4 September 1621, carrying a cargo that included silver for trade in the East Indies as well as a gift for the King of Siam. She stopped at Cape Town for supplies on 19 March 1622. The East India Company had only recently issued orders requiring that its ships sail south of 32°S when en route to the East Indies, as this course made use of the so-called roaring forties and could save up to six months travel time off the more traditional northern route.
Neither Brooke nor any of his crew had sailed via the new southern route previously, or even to Batavia, and they asked in Cape Town for experienced sailors willing to join their crew. Thomas Bright was subsequently recruited off Charles (1000 tons (bm)) as first mate.
The vessel departed on 19 March 1622 and sighted the Australian coast on 1 May 1622, apparently mistaking Point Cloates approximately 100 kilometres south-south-west of North West Cape on the mainland for an island that Captain Lenaert Jacobszoon and Supercargo Willem Janszoon in the Dutch East India Company ship Mauritius had encountered in 1618 and which is now known as Barrow Island. This navigation error was caused by having sailed too far east, a common problem of the time before an accurate means of fixing a ship's longitude existed.


== Wreck ==

Turning north, they then encountered several weeks of fresh north to north-westerly winds which impeded progress. Finally, the winds turned to favourable south-westerlies and they started to make good progress to their destination of Batavia. On 25 May 1622 at between 10 and 11pm she struck uncharted submerged rocks about 32 km (20 mi) north-west of the outer edge of the Montebello Islands group, the southern boundary of which is about 8 km (5.0 mi) north of the northern tip of Barrow Island.
The reef is named Tryal Rocks after the ship and is located at 20°16′18″S 115°23′18″E (-20.271627, 115.388253).
Captain Brooke, his son John and nine men scrambled into a skiff and Thomas Bright and 35 others managed to save a longboat. The two boats sailed separately, but 44 survivors reached Bantam on 21 June. The skiff arrived at Batavia on 5 July 1622 and the longboat three days later — a voyage of over 1,800 km (1,100 mi). Of the 143 men who had left England, 93 had perished at the wreck site, and one person died in the skiff.


== Investigation ==
On his arrival in Batavia, Brooke wrote to his masters in London blaming Captain Fitzherbert, who had been the first British captain to pioneer the southern route across the Indian Ocean after Dutch captain Hendrik Brouwer. Brooke declared that he had followed the route specified by Fitzherbert and had struck rocks where Fitzherbert had said there were none. He said Fitzherbert's incorrect mapping had been the cause for the disaster and denied any responsibility. Brooke claimed that the reef site was well west of the actual site in an attempt to hide his easterly course. He also claimed that all the cargo, including the silver and the ship's papers, had gone down with the ship when it broke up and sank at about 2am.
Thomas Bright secretly and separately wrote to London. He directly blamed Brooke for the loss of the ship and her crew, blaming Brooke's poor navigation and his failure to post a lookout. He said that after striking the reef, Brooke had hurriedly abandoned the ship and fled into the skiff. According to Bright, Brooke had departed the site immediately, leaving many men in the water to drown though the skiff had room for additional men. Bright's longboat was full to capacity and stood about a quarter mile off the wreck due to the danger of capsizing if any of the men in the water attempted to climb on board. He further contradicted Brooke by stating the ship had not sunk until mid-morning the following day.
Subsequent analysis of these reports and other documents, as well as searches of the wreck site, have raised suspicions that Brooke had secretly removed at least part of the silver into the skiff before the ship sank, and had managed to get it to Batavia without telling anyone.


== John Brooke's later career ==
After he returned to London, Captain Brooke was given the command of another British East India Company ship, Moone. Moone was wrecked off the coast of Dover, possibly deliberately. A two-year court case, during which Brooke was imprisoned, ended with the case being dropped.


== Discovery ==
Due to Captain Brooke's actions, for well over three centuries there was great confusion as to the exact position of the Tryal Rocks. William Dampier, for example was one mariner who searched for them. After examining the records and Thomas Bright's letter in 1934 historian Ida Lee proved that what was then known as Ritchie's Reef was the site. The Australia Pilot was subsequently amended and the reef renamed. It was not until 1969 with the advent of recreational SCUBA diving on the Western Australian coast that the wreck was located after researchers John MacPherson and Eric Christiansen of the Fremantle-based Underwater Explorer's Club determined the position after examining Lee's research and the contemporary records. When an exploration team went to the south western side of the reef which Christiansen had predicted as being the likely location, diver Naoom Haimson almost immediately found the wreck. Members of the dive team were Christiansen, Haimson, Dave Nelley and Ellis Alfred (Alan) Robinson. Chris Muhlmann was skipper of the boat.
Shortly after the discovery, Robinson attempted an illegal salvage operation where his use of explosives badly damaged the wreck site. He had been involved in an earlier operation involving the wrecks Vergulde Draeck north of Perth and Zuytdorp north of Kalbarri. After he had illegally removed objects, including a bronze swivel gun and other artefacts, Robinson was apprehended in Shark Bay. His actions in challenging the state Shipwrecks Acts when prosecuted for his actions, his salvage attempts, and his continual fights with the bureaucracy led to considerable press and his becoming dubbed in the media and in a subsequent film by Prospero Productions as the 'Gelignite Buccaneer'. His challenge to the State Maritime Archaeology Act eventually led to enactment of Commonwealth legislation protecting wrecks around Australia. While in prison on an unrelated assault charge, Alan Robinson hanged himself.
Led by maritime archaeologist Jeremy Green, divers from the Western Australian Maritime Museum followed up on an earlier Museum expedition under Harry Bingham and conducted a detailed examination of the wreck site in 1971. This was effected subsequent to the receipt of substantial sponsorship from M.G. Kailis of Gulf Fisheries. The wreck was found divided into two main sections separated by a sand gully. Heavy swell made conditions very difficult and they precluded a detailed inspection of the easternmost section of the site. While six cannon, and up to eight anchors of a type expected from the period and some small objects were recorded, no artefacts were found that allowed a positive identification of the site. While the number of anchors suggested a larger ship, the number of cannon pointed to a small vessel like Tryall; in the absence of definitive objects, to Green the evidence remained 'equivocal' but he did conclude that the wreck was most likely Tryall. The consensus amongst maritime investigators is that it almost certainly is Tryall. The Museum's display in the Shipwreck Galleries at Fremantle houses a small number of recovered items, including a large iron cannon that was recovered on a later Museum expedition.

She made nine voyages to the East between 1796 and 1816, most direct to China. In 1804 she participated in the Battle of Pulo Aura. In 1816, the company sold her for breaking up.


== Origins ==
She was the second East Indiaman under that name that John Perry built at his yard in Blackwall Yard. Perry built her predecessor in 1788; in 1795 the East India Company sold the first of Perry's Warleys to the Royal Navy, which renamed her HMS Calcutta.
Warley's captain for her first five voyages was Henry Wilson, who had also been captain of the first Warley for her two voyages.


== Voyages 1, 2 and 3 ==
Warley sailed under a letter of marque dated 1 January 1797, which named Wilson as the captain.
Voyage 1: The destination was the coast of India and China. Warley left on 19 March 1797 and arrived back in British waters on 22 October 1798.
Voyage 2: The destination was China. She left on 18 June 1799 and returned on 2 October 1800.
Voyage 3: The destination was China. She left on 19 May 1801 and returned on 9 September 1802.


== Voyage 4: the Battle of Pulo Aura ==
The Napoleonic Wars having broken out, Wilson took out a second letter of marque, this one dated 20 June 1803. Warley left Britain on 6 May 1803 for China. It was on the return leg of this voyage that Warley had her greatest moment of glory.

Wilson, in Warley, was second in command to Nathaniel Dance, who commanded the East Indiamen that were sailing in convoy back from China. As they were passing through the Straits of Malacca, they encountered a French squadron under Rear-Admiral the Comte de Linois, who hoped to seize as many of them as he could.
Dance ordered his fleet to form a line of battle, while creating a bluff that four of his Indiamen were a squadron of ships of the line escorting the convoy. A skirmish ensued with the result that Linois, somewhat inexplicably, withdrew.
Warley played a significant part and Lloyd's Patriotic Fund voted Wilson 500 guineas and a piece of plate worth 50 guineas. All the other captains received similar awards, with the officers and crews also receiving awards. Dance refused a baronetcy but was subsequently knighted.
Warley arrived back in Britain on 14 August 1804.


== Voyages 5 to 9 ==
Voyage 5: Wilson sailed Warley to China. She left on 25 April 1805 and returned on 7 September 1806.
Voyage 6: Captain William Augustus Montague took over command. He sailed Warley to Madras, Ceylon, Bombay and China. She left on 22 June 1807 and returned on 10 December 1809. Her itinerary was Portsmouth, Simons Bay, Cape of Good Hope, Madras, Colombo, Tellicherry, Managalore, Bombay, Penang, Whampoa anchorage, St Helena, and Blackwall.
Voyage 7: Captain John Collins left Portsmouth on 8 April 1811 for China via Simons Bay and Penang, arriving at Whampoa on 22 October. She left the Pearl River on 12 January 1812 and returned on 14 May, having stopped in St Helena.
Voyage 8: Collins left Portsmouth on 18 March 1813 for Madras and China. She sailed via Tenerife and Johanna (Comoro Islands), arriving at Madras on 9 August. She then sailed via Penang and Malacca, arriving at Whampoa on 25 October. She left on 22 February 1814 and by 6 August was in the Downs, having stopped at St Helena on the way.
Voyage 9: Collins left the Downs on 3 April 1815 and reached Whampoa on 11 September. She left on 3 December and on 29 April arrived at the Downs, having stopped at St Helena. This was her last voyage.


== Fate ==
Warley was sold on 26 July 1816 at Lloyd's Coffee House for breaking up.


== Notable passengers ==
The first academic director of the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, when it commenced operations in 1808, was Professor James Inman, who had returned to Britain from Port Jackson on the Warley. He was on board during the Battle of Pulo Auro and commanded a party of Lascar pikemen.
The marine painter Clarkson Stanfield joined the merchant service under the name "Patrick Bland" as a seaman on board the Warley and sailed for China in 1815. He made numerous sketches on the voyage, which gave him material for his subsequent career.
