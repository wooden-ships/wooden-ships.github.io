OCLC 67375475.A hulk is a ship that is afloat, but incapable of going to sea. Although sometimes used to describe a ship that has been launched but not completed, the term most often refers to an old ship that has had its rigging or internal equipment removed, retaining only its flotational qualities. The word "hulk" is also used as a verb: a ship is "hulked" to convert it to a hulk.
Although the term "hulk" can be used to refer to an abandoned wreck or shell, it is much more commonly applied to hulls that are still performing a useful function. In the days of sail, many hulls served longer as hulks than they did as functional ships. Wooden ships were often hulked when the hull structure became too old and weak to withstand the stresses of sailing.
More recently, ships have been hulked when they become obsolete or when they become uneconomical to operate.


== Sheer hulk ==

A sheer hulk (or shear hulk) was used in shipbuilding and repair as a floating crane in the days of sailing ships, primarily to place the lower masts of a ship under construction or repair. Booms known as sheers were attached to the base of a hulk's lower masts or beam, supported from the top of those masts. Blocks & tackle were then used in such tasks as placing or removing the lower masts of vessel under construction or repair. These lower masts were the largest and most massive single timbers aboard a ship, and erecting them without the assistance of either a sheer hulk or land-based masting sheer was extremely difficult.
The concept of sheer hulks originated with the Royal Navy in the 1690s, and persisted in Britain until the early nineteenth century. Most sheer hulks were decommissioned warships though the Royal Navy constructed one purpose-built vessel, HMS Chatham Hulk in 1694. There were at least six sheer hulks in service in Britain at any time throughout the 1700s. The concept spread to France in the 1740s with the commissioning of a sheer hulk at the port of Rochefort.
By 1807 the Royal Navy had standardised sheer hulk crew numbers to comprise a boatswain, mate and six seamen, with larger numbers coming aboard only when the sheers were in use.


== Accommodation hulk ==

An accommodation hulk is a hulk used as housing, generally when there is a lack of quarters available ashore. An operational ship may be used for accommodation, but a hulk can accommodate more personnel than the same hull would accommodate as a functional ship. For this role, the hulk is often extensively modified to improve living conditions. Receiving hulks and prison hulks are specialized types of accommodation hulks. During World War II, purpose-built barracks ships were used in this role.


=== Receiving hulk ===

A receiving ship is a ship used in harbour to house newly recruited sailors before they are assigned to a ship's crew.
In the Royal Navy, the use of impressment to collect sailors resulted in the problem of preventing escape of the unwilling "recruits". The receiving ship was part of the solution; it was difficult to get off the ship without being detected, and most seamen of the era did not know how to swim.
Receiving ships were typically older vessels that could still be kept afloat, but were obsolete or no longer seaworthy. The practice was especially common in the age of wooden ships, since the old hulls would remain afloat for many years in relatively still waters after they had become too weak to withstand the rigors of the open ocean.
Receiving ships often served as floating hospitals as many were assigned in locations without shore-based station hospitals. Often the afloat surgeon would take up station on the receiving ship.


=== Prison hulk ===

A prison hulk was a hulk used as a floating prison. They were used extensively in Great Britain, the Royal Navy producing a steady supply of ships too worn-out to use in combat, but still afloat. Their widespread use was a result of the large number of French sailors captured during the Seven Years' War, and continued throughout the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars a half-century later. By 1814 there were eighteen prison hulks operating at Portsmouth, sixteen at Plymouth and ten at Chatham.
Prison hulks were also convenient for holding civilian prisoners, commencing in Britain in 1776 when the American Revolution prevented the sending of convicts to North America. Instead, increasingly large numbers of British convicts were held aboard hulks in the major seaports and landed ashore in daylight hours for manual labour such as harbor dredging. From 1786 prison hulks were also used as temporary gaols for convicts being transported to Australia.


== Powder hulk ==
A powder hulk was a hulk used to store gunpowder. The hulk was a floating warehouse which could be moved as needed to simplify the transfer of gunpowder to warships. Its location, away from land, also reduced the possible damage from an explosion.


== Salvage pontoon ==

Hulks were used in pairs during salvage operations. By passing heavy cables under a wreck and connecting them to two hulks, a wreck could be raised using the lifting force of the tide or by changing the buoyancy of the hulks.


== Floating storage and offloading units ==
Several of the largest former oil tankers were converted to floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units, effectively very large floating oil storage tanks. The Knock Nevis, by some measures the largest ship ever built, served in this capacity from 2004 until 2010. In 2009 and 2010 two of the four TI-class supertankers, then the largest ships afloat, TI Asia and TI Africa, were converted to FPSOs.


== Coal hulks ==
Service as a coal hulk was usually, but not always, a ship's last.
Of the fate of the fast and elegant clipper ships, William L. Carothers wrote, "Clippers functioned well as barges; their fine ends made for little resistance when under tow ... The ultimate degradation awaited a barge. There was no way up, only down-- down to the category of coal hulks ... Having strong solid bottoms ... they could handle the great weight of bulk coal which filled their holds. It was a grimy, untidy, unglamorous end for any vessel which had seen the glory days."
The famed clipper Red Jacket ended her days as a coaling hulk in the Cape Verde Islands.

One by one these old Champions of the Seas disappeared. The Young America was last seen lying off Gibraltar as a coal hulk; and that superb old greyhound of the ocean, the Flying Cloud suffered a similar ignominious ending. She was not even spared the humiliation of concealing her tragic end from the eyes of her former envious rivals, but was condemned to end her days as a New Haven scow towed up the Sound with a load of brick and concrete behind a stuck up parvenu tug. Ever and anon as if to emphasize her newly acquired importance, the tug would bury the old-time square-rigged beauty in a cloud of filthy smoke. Imagine the feelings of an ex-Cape Horner under such conditions! There should have been a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Old Clippers. Everybody who knows anything about ships, knows that they have feelings just the same as anybody else.


== Other services ==
A vessel's hulking may not be its final use. Scuttling as a blockship, breakwater, artificial reef, or recreational dive site may await. Some are repurposed, for example as a gambling ship; others are restored and put to new uses, such as a museum ship. Some even return revitalized to sea.
When lumber schooner Johanna Smith, "one of only two Pacific Coast steam schooners to be powered by steam turbines," was hulked in 1928, she was moored off Long Beach, California and used as a gambling ship, until a fire of unknown cause finished her off.
One vessel rescued from this ignominious end was the barque Polly Woodside, now a museum ship in Melbourne, Australia. Another is the James Craig, rescued from Recherche Bay in Tasmania, now restored and regularly sailing from Sydney, Australia.

OCLC 67375475.Clarkia is a genus within the flowering plant family Onagraceae. Over 40 species are currently classified in Clarkia; almost all are native to western North America, though one species (Clarkia tenella) is native to South America.
Clarkias are typically annual plants, growing to a height of less than 1.5 metres. Their leaves are small and simple, from 1 to 10 cm in length depending on the species. Their flowers have four sepals and four petals.
Several members of the genus are sometimes referred to by the common name "Godetia", including Clarkia amoena, Clarkia affinis, and Clarkia lassenensis (the Lassen Godetia). This is because they were formerly classified in a genus called Godetia, which is no longer recognised since its members have been absorbed into the Clarkia genus. Older sources may still use Godetia as a genus name.
The genus was named in honour of the explorer Captain William Clark.
The Royal Navy had a warship called HMS Clarkia, a flower class corvette.


== Cultivation ==
Some species are popular garden plants, for example the Mountain Garland, Clarkia unguiculata, the Redspot Clarkia, Clarkia speciosa, Farewell to Spring, Clarkia amoena and Clarkia bottae. There are cultivated varieties of some of these species.

Jepson Manual treatment of the genusThe Constant Warwick was a 32-gun fourth rate frigate which served in the English Royal Navy, built by Peter Pett I at Ratcliff and launched in 1645. She is sometimes regarded as the 'first English frigate', although a number of vessels built or acquired earlier (during the 1630s and 1640s) also merit a similar description. The term 'frigate' during the period of this ship referred to a method of construction, rather than a role which did not develop until the following century.
She was not built for the Navy, but was built as a privateer for a consortium which included the Earl of Warwick (hence her name) and Sir William Batten (Surveyor of the Navy), but was hired by the navy from 1646 until 20 January 1649, when she was purchased outright.
Constant Warwick was rebuilt at least once. Her original dimensions altered by 1660, evidence that she may have seen structural changes during the 1650s. She was certainly rebuilt by Sir John Tippetts at Portsmouth Dockyard in 1666 as a 42-gun fourth rate ship of the line. Her armament had been reduced to 40 guns by 1685, with eighteen demi-culverins (drakes) on the lower deck, eighteen sakers (6-pounder guns) on the upper deck, and four 3-pounder guns on the quarter deck. She was downgraded to a fifth rate in 1691, scheduled to be reduced to 28 guns, but before this took effect she was captured on 12 July 1691 off Portugal by a French squadron.

== History ==

Port Egmont was established in on 25 January 1765, by an expedition led by Commodore John Byron consisting of the boats HMS Dolphin, HMS Tamar and HMS Florida. The expedition left a watering place and a vegetable garden.
Another expedition arrived around a year later in January 1766, led by Captain John MacBride, with the ships HMS Jason, HMS Carcass and HMS Experiment after which Carcass Island and the Jason Islands are named. This was to secure possession, and McBride ordered one of the ships to stay at Port Egmont, and develop the settlement, resulting in several permanent buildings and a garrison.
The next few years resulted in conflicting claims with the French and Spanish, with the British using Port Egmont as a basis for their claim. In early 1770 Spanish commander Don Juan Ignacio de Madariaga briefly visited Port Egmont. He returned from Argentina on 10 June with five armed ships and a 1400 soldiers forcing the British to leave Port Egmont.
In 1771, after threats of war with Spain, the colony was re-established by Captain John Stott with the ships HMS Juno, HMS Hound and HMS Florida, the latter being at the founding of the original settlement. The port became an important stop for ships going around Cape Horn
In 1774, Britain abandoned many of its overseas garrisons for economic reasons and Port Egmont was no exception, and in 1776, the British forces left. In the next few years, the colony was taken over by sealers, until in 1780 it was finally destroyed under orders from Spanish authorities.

HMS Foxglove
HMS Foxhound
HMS Flying Fox
Fox (ship), Arctic exploration vessel.HMS Foxglove was an Acacia-class minesweeping sloop of the Royal Navy built at Glasgow, Scotland, by Barclay Curle and launched on 30 March 1915. She entered service later that year. During World War I, she and the other Acacia-class sloops were used almost exclusively for minesweeping duties until 1917, when the Royal Navy began to use them as convoy escorts, a task to which they were well suited.


== Service in Chinese waters ==
Foxglove served on the China Station during the early 1920s. In 1921, she joined the Royal Navy light cruiser Carlisle and the commercial steamer SS Shansi in rescuing survivors of the passenger steamship SS Hong Moh, which had wrecked on 3 March 1921 near Swatow, China, with a loss of around 1,000 lives; Carlisle rescued 221 survivors, while Shansi saved 45 and Foxglove 28.


== World War II ==
Foxglove was one of only two Acacia-class sloops to survive long enough to see service in World War II. She became a loss when she was dive-bombed and badly damaged by German aircraft off the Isle of Wight on 9 July 1940. She remained afloat, and was converted into an accommodation ship and base ship. In this new role, she became a harbour guard ship in 1941, serving at Londonderry (also known as Derry) in Northern Ireland for the remainder of World War II.


== Fate ==
The last surviving Acacia-class sloop, Foxglove was sold for scrapping on 7 September 1946. She was scrapped at Troon, Scotland.


== Legacy ==
Foxglove's logbook is among those that was selected for digitisation as part of the online Old Weather project.

BibliographyThree ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Espion, meaning "spy". A fourth vessel was going to bear the name but was given ano0ther name instead:
HMS Espion was a 16-gun French Levrette-class cutter launched in 1781, captured in 1782 and sold in 1784.
HMS Espion was the 16-gun French privateer sloop Robert that the British captured in 1793. The French recaptured her in 1794, before the British recaptured her in 1795. There being another Espion in service by then, the British renamed their capture HMS Spy and she served under that name until the Navy sold her in 1801. She then became a whaling ship, a privateer, and again a whaler, serving in the South Seas whale fisheries until at least 1813.
HMS Espion was the French frigate Atalante, which the British captured in 1794 and later converted to a store or troopship. She was wrecked, with no loss of life, in 1799.
Espion was the name initially chosen for Little Belt.

Hepper, David J. (1994). British Warship Losses in the Age of Sail, 1650-1859. Rotherfield: Jean Boudriot. ISBN 0-948864-30-3.The Bangor-class minesweepers were a class of warships operated by the Royal Navy (RN), Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), and Royal Indian Navy (RIN) during the Second World War.
The class derives its name from the lead ship, HMS Bangor (J00), which was launched on 19 February 1940 and commissioned on 7 November of that year. Royal Navy ships were named after coastal towns of the United Kingdom.
Their lack of size gave them poor sea handling abilities, reportedly worse even than the Flower class corvettes. The diesel-engined versions were considered to have poorer handling characteristics than the slow-speed reciprocating-engined variants. Their shallow draft made them unstable and their short hulls tended to bury the bow when operating in a head sea.
The Bangor-class vessels were also considered overcrowded, cramming six officers and over 90 ratings into a vessel originally intended for a total of 40.
Despite claims to the contrary, the Australian Bathurst-class corvette was a wholly Australian design, and not based on the Bangor class.


== Design and development ==
The original intent of the Bangor-class minesweeper design was to provide a coastal equivalent of the Halcyon-class minesweeper; however the realities brought to light by the start of the war caused a modification of the design before construction had started.
The need for quick construction coupled with the limitations of engineering resources resulted in several variations existing based on the availability of propulsion machinery. The ships all had twin screws, but the machinery was a mix of steam turbine, slow-speed steam reciprocating, high-speed steam reciprocating and diesel. The diesel powered examples were about 20 feet (6 m) shorter than the rest as they had no need for boiler rooms. Displacement varied with propulsion machinery from 590 to 672 tons. The reciprocating engine powered Bangors were also known as the Blyth class and the steam turbine powered versions as the Ardrossan class.
The class was considered cramped for the purposes it was built for, with not enough room provided for the acoustic and magnetic minesweeping gear carried.

She was commissioned into the Gibraltar Squadron on 31 January 2003 (along with her sister Scimitar), and is used for police, customs and rescue purposes. The two boats allowed the two Archer-class patrol vessels of the squadron, Trumpeter and Ranger, to be reassigned to the Cyprus Squadron in April 2003 and April 2004 respectively.

The boat had previously been used in Northern Ireland since 1993 as MV Grey Wolf and was based in Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland where she was manned by Royal Marines.


== April 2009 Incident ==
On Friday 10 April 2009 a vessel from Spain's Civil Guard Police force entered Gibraltar territorial waters unannounced and approached the area near Gibraltar Airport. HMS Sabre approached, and there was no response from the Spanish vessel. It was warned to leave the territorial waters, and after consulting with its superiors it did so. However, accounts vary between the Royal Navy and the Spanish versions. The Royal Navy states that its guns were armed at the time, however the Spanish accounts state that the guns were specifically pointed at the Spanish vessel. In addition, Spanish MP Jose Ignacio Landaluce from the People's Party has vowed to take up the issue in Parliament. He said Spain "would not allow a Civil Guard vessel to be expelled from its own home".

Monmouth was the name of a castle and is now the name of a town in Wales; the name also recognises James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, the "Black Duke". The first HMS Monmouth was named after the town but whilst the second one was being used the Monmouth Rebellion took place and this caused some concern to the crew. Since that time, all of Monmouths have had their names painted in black and the name and the creat are covered because of the shame of the Duke of Monmouth's execution. Today the officers of the latest HMS Monmouth carry black handkerchiefs and the ship is known as the Black Duke. However the town of Monmouth still gives the freedom of the town to the ship's crew and talks of the "enduring link" between the town and the ship.

In 1766, under the command of Sir Thomas Adams, the Niger travelled to Newfoundland and Labrador. Also on board were Constantine Phipps, and the English botanist Joseph Banks. The purpose of the journey was to transport a party of mariners to Chateau Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador to build a fort, to continue strengthening relations with the native population, and to survey some of the coast of Newfoundland.
Banks collected many species of plants and animals during that journey, including many which were previously unknown or undescribed by Europeans. In 1766 Banks met James Cook briefly in St. John's, Newfoundland, through their mutual friend Thomas Adams. This meeting would lead to Banks joining Cook on his first circumnavigation from 1769 to 1771.
Because Niger served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp "Egypt" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants.
